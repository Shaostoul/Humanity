# Humanity

**Wholesomely aiding humanity's betterment.**

---

We build open-source tools and education to end poverty — not through handouts, but through capability. Life is finite and sacred. Removing barriers to living is the work.

Everything we build is **public domain**. No accounts. No tracking. No gatekeeping. Just tools and knowledge for anyone, anywhere, forever.

## Live Now: Humanity Chat

**[united-humanity.us/chat](https://united-humanity.us/chat)**

The communication layer comes first. Our chat is live with:

- **No accounts, no tracking, no IP logging** — cryptographic identity (Ed25519) stored in your browser
- **Direct messages** between users + multiple channels
- **@mentions**, emoji reactions, message editing, image sharing
- **Browser notifications** so you never miss a message
- **User profiles** with bio and social links
- **Moderation tools** — admin/mod roles, lockdown, invite codes
- **Pin system** — server pins for everyone + personal pins just for you
- **Security hardened** — rate limiting, upload validation, CSP headers, TLS 1.2+

Come say hello.

### Host Your Own Server

Anyone can run a Humanity Network server. No permission needed. Verified servers that adopt the [Humanity Accord](accord) earn the highest trust tier. [Learn more →](https://github.com/Shaostoul/Humanity/blob/main/design/network/server_federation.md)

## What We're Building

**The Humanity Accord**
Civilizational principles for how humans cooperate at scale — across cultures, distances, and generations — without domination or exploitation as defaults.
→ [Read the Accord](accord)

**The Humanity Network**
An E2E encrypted, peer-to-peer, federated communication protocol. No central servers. No passwords. Cryptographic identity means you prove who you are with math.

**Project Universe**
A free, open-source game teaching practical skills — homesteading, agriculture, building, health, survival. Learn to provide for yourself and your community.

## Why This Exists

Poverty isn't just lack of money — it's lack of capability. People trapped in systems they can't escape, knowledge they can't access, skills they never learned.

In 2017, Michael Boisson nearly died. That experience stripped away the noise and left one clear answer: help people become capable of helping themselves. By 2019, that answer had a name and a plan.

Education is the foundation. Tools are the path. Community is the engine.
