# Humanity

**A cooperative path toward a shared destiny.**

---

We share one world, one future, and one set of consequences.

Humanity is an open project exploring how we can live together—across cultures, distances, and generations—without domination, exploitation, or violence as default tools.

This isn't ideology. It doesn't require faith or allegiance. It's a practical framework: principles we can build on, test, revise, and scale.

## What We're Building

**The Humanity Accord**  
A living document defining how humans can cooperate at scale while preserving dignity, agency, and shared responsibility.  
→ [Read the Accord](accord)

**Project Universe**  
A free, open-source game teaching practical skills—homesteading, building, survival—so anyone, anywhere, can learn to provide for themselves and their community.

## Why This Exists

Poverty isn't just lack of money—it's lack of capability. People trapped in systems they can't escape, knowledge they can't access, skills they never learned.

We believe education is the foundation. Not just facts, but *capability*: how to grow food, build shelter, maintain health, cooperate with others.

A game can teach this. A framework can guide it. A community can build it.
