# Humanity

**Wholesomely aiding humanity's betterment.**

---

We build open-source tools and education to end poverty — not through handouts, but through capability. Life is finite and sacred. Removing barriers to living is the work.

Everything we build is **public domain** (CC0). No accounts. No tracking. No gatekeeping. Just tools and knowledge for anyone, anywhere, forever.

Platform is **18+ only**. Free speech — the line is genuine threats, doxxing, and predatory harassment.

## Live Now: Humanity Chat & Hub

**[united-humanity.us/chat](https://united-humanity.us/chat)**

A fully operational communication platform and personal hub. No account needed — your cryptographic identity (Ed25519) lives in your browser.

### Communication
- **Channels** — public rooms for group conversation
- **Direct messages** — private 1-on-1 chat (friend requirement for privacy)
- **Groups** — private group conversations
- **Voice chat** — WebRTC peer-to-peer 1-on-1 voice calls
- **Persistent voice channels** — always-on voice rooms to join/leave
- **@mentions**, emoji reactions (persistent), message editing, image sharing
- **Browser notifications** with 6 notification sound options

### Social
- **Follow/friend system** — mutual follow = friends, friends unlock DMs
- **User profiles** — bio, social links, identicons
- **Blocking and reporting** tools

### Hub Tools
- **Project board** — kanban-style task management
- **Marketplace** — peer-to-peer listings for goods and services
- **Universal catalog** — elements, materials, processing chains
- **Personal inventory** — track what you own
- **Notes** — private note-taking
- **Todos** — personal task lists
- **Garden tracker** — plan and track your garden

### Game & Creative
- **Fantasy tab** — character sheet, lore entries, world map, achievements
- **Streams tab** — local capture demo (real streaming coming soon)
- **Concept art** — multi-km spaceships, virtual malls, in-game spaces

### Platform
- **PWA** — installable on mobile, works offline-capable
- **Settings panel** — accent colors, font sizes, theme customization
- **Command palette** — quick access to everything
- **Key backup/export/import** — own your identity, move between devices
- **Auto-sync** — user data syncs to server automatically
- **Security hardened** — rate limiting, upload validation, CSP headers, TLS 1.2+
- **Moderation tools** — admin/mod roles, lockdown, invite codes

### Federation & Self-Hosting
- **Server federation Phase 1** — server discovery, trust tiers, anyone can host a server
- Single binary, zero dependencies, under 10 minutes to set up
- Verified servers that adopt the [Humanity Accord](accord) earn the highest trust tier

## What's Planned

- **E2E encrypted DMs** — X25519 key exchange, server never sees plaintext
- **Federation Phase 2** — server-to-server messaging across instances
- **Desktop app** — Tauri-based native binary for Windows/Mac/Linux
- **Video calls** — add video to existing WebRTC voice system
- **Actual WebRTC streaming** — peer-assisted streaming (creator → relay → peer mesh)
- **Native game client** — first-person Rust client with in-game chat + AI
- **P2P game distribution** — GitHub Releases, no app stores, no middlemen
- **In-game commerce** — virtual mall with real retailer kiosks
- **Asset library system** — organized art/models/audio with tags and cloud backup

## What We're Building

**The Humanity Accord**
Civilizational principles for how humans cooperate at scale — across cultures, distances, and generations — without domination or exploitation as defaults.
→ [Read the Accord](accord)

**The Humanity Network**
A federated communication protocol built on Ed25519 cryptographic identity. No central servers. No passwords. You prove who you are with math.

**Project Universe**
A free, open-source game teaching practical skills — homesteading, agriculture, building, health, survival. Learn to provide for yourself and your community.

## Why This Exists

Poverty isn't just lack of money — it's lack of capability. People trapped in systems they can't escape, knowledge they can't access, skills they never learned.

In 2017, Michael Boisson nearly died. That experience stripped away the noise and left one clear answer: help people become capable of helping themselves. By 2019, that answer had a name and a plan.

Education is the foundation. Tools are the path. Community is the engine.
