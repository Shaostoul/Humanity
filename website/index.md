# Humanity

**Wholesomely aiding humanity's betterment.**

---

We build open-source tools and education to end poverty — not through handouts, but through capability. Life is finite and sacred. Removing barriers to living is the work.

Everything we build is **public domain** (CC0). No accounts. No tracking. No gatekeeping. Just tools and knowledge for anyone, anywhere, forever.

Platform is **18+ only**. Free speech — the line is genuine threats, doxxing, and predatory harassment.

## What We're Building

**The Humanity Accord**
Civilizational principles for how humans cooperate at scale — across cultures, distances, and generations — without domination or exploitation as defaults.
→ [Read the Accord](accord)

**The Humanity Network**
A federated communication protocol built on Ed25519 cryptographic identity. No central servers. No passwords. You prove who you are with math.

**Project Universe**
A free, open-source game teaching practical skills — homesteading, agriculture, building, health, survival. Learn to provide for yourself and your community.

## Why This Exists

Poverty isn't just lack of money — it's lack of capability. People trapped in systems they can't escape, knowledge they can't access, skills they never learned.

In 2017, Michael Boisson nearly died. That experience stripped away the noise and left one clear answer: help people become capable of helping themselves. By 2019, that answer had a name and a plan.

Education is the foundation. Tools are the path. Community is the engine.
