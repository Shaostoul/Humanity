# About

## The Person

My name is Michael Boisson. I've been building things in games since I was six years old.

My dad introduced me to modding before I understood what I was doing. By 2006, I was teaching others—voluntarily, for free—how to modify games like Warcraft 3, Freelancer, Morrowind, and later Space Engineers. Over the years, I created more than a thousand custom blocks for Space Engineers alone. Not weapons (everyone makes weapons). Infrastructure. The boring stuff that lets other people build their dreams.

On December 24, 2017, I nearly died.

When you're that close to the edge, you stop asking "what should I do?" and start asking "what actually matters?"

For me, the answer was clear: I wanted to help people become capable of helping themselves. Not charity. Capability.

By January 2019, that answer had a name: **Project Universe**.

## The Project

**Project Universe** is a free, open-source game designed to teach people how to homestead—anywhere in the universe, including Earth.

Why homesteading? Because it's the foundation of human capability:
- **Food security** — grow what you need
- **Shelter** — build where you are
- **Health** — understand your body and environment
- **Education** — learn by doing
- **Community** — cooperate to thrive

The game won't be finished tomorrow. It won't be finished next year. But it will be open from day one. Anyone can contribute. Anyone can learn. Anyone can fork it and make it better.

The goal isn't a product. It's a platform for human flourishing.

## The Framework

Games teach, but principles guide.

The **Humanity Accord** is a living framework for how humans can cooperate at scale—without requiring everyone to agree on religion, politics, or culture. Just on a few baseline truths:

- Dignity is non-negotiable
- Power must be accountable
- Systems must be understandable
- The future belongs to those who build for it

## The Network

Communication comes first. If people can't talk to each other freely and privately, nothing else gets built.

The **Humanity Network** is an E2E encrypted, peer-to-peer, federated communication protocol. No accounts. No tracking. Ed25519 cryptographic identity — you own your keys, not us.

**It's live now:** [chat.united-humanity.us](https://chat.united-humanity.us)

## The Mission

**End poverty by building capability.**

Not through handouts or programs, but through knowledge and tools that anyone can access, anywhere, forever.

This is a long game. I might not see it finished. But I can lay foundations that others can build on.

That's what I'm here to do.
