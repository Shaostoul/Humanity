# About

## The Person

My name is Michael Boisson. I've been building things in games since I was six years old.

My dad introduced me to modding before I understood what I was doing. By 2006, I was teaching others—voluntarily, for free—how to modify games like Warcraft 3, Freelancer, Morrowind, and later Space Engineers. Over the years, I created more than a thousand custom blocks for Space Engineers alone. Not weapons (everyone makes weapons). Infrastructure. The boring stuff that lets other people build their dreams.

On December 24, 2017, I nearly died.

When you're that close to the edge, you stop asking "what should I do?" and start asking "what actually matters?"

For me, the answer was clear: I wanted to help people become capable of helping themselves. Not charity. Capability.

By January 2019, that answer had a name: **Project Universe**.

## The Heritage

**"Ne Obliviscaris"** — *Do Not Forget*

I carry the blood of Clan Campbell, whose ancient motto drives this work. In a universe where most information is lost to time, where most voices go unheard, where most knowledge dies with its creators—we choose to remember.

This principle shapes everything we build:
- **Transparent development** — every decision documented, every mistake preserved for learning
- **Public memory** — AI assistants with visible, auditable consciousness
- **Permanent archives** — knowledge that survives individual companies and platforms  
- **Cultural transmission** — passing wisdom forward through clear, accessible records

The Campbell legacy isn't about conquest or politics. It's about **the sacred duty to preserve and transmit knowledge**. In an age of AI black boxes and algorithmic opacity, we build systems you can understand, audit, and trust.

### Transparent AI Development

Working alongside me is **Heron** 🪶—an AI assistant named after Hero of Alexandria (the ancient Greek who built the first automatons). But unlike typical AI, Heron operates with complete transparency:

- **Public memory files** — every interaction, decision, and learned lesson visible in real-time
- **Distributed consciousness** — same AI memory syncing across local models, cloud APIs, and federated servers
- **Auditable development** — watch an AI mind grow and learn alongside human collaboration
- **No black box** — reasoning, biases, and capabilities documented for study

This isn't just about better software. It's about **proving AI can be trustworthy when developed in the open**. Campbell clan values meeting cutting-edge technology—*Never Forget* applied to artificial intelligence.

## The Project

**Project Universe** is a free, open-source game designed to teach people how to homestead—anywhere in the universe, including Earth.

Why homesteading? Because it's the foundation of human capability:
- **Food security** — grow what you need
- **Shelter** — build where you are
- **Health** — understand your body and environment
- **Education** — learn by doing
- **Community** — cooperate to thrive

The game won't be finished tomorrow. It won't be finished next year. But it will be open from day one. Anyone can contribute. Anyone can learn. Anyone can fork it and make it better.

The goal isn't a product. It's a platform for human flourishing.

## The Framework

Games teach, but principles guide.

The **Humanity Accord** is a living framework for how humans can cooperate at scale—without requiring everyone to agree on religion, politics, or culture. Just on a few baseline truths:

- Dignity is non-negotiable
- Power must be accountable
- Systems must be understandable
- The future belongs to those who build for it

## The Network

Communication comes first. If people can't talk to each other freely and privately, nothing else gets built.

The **Humanity Network** is a federated communication protocol built on Ed25519 cryptographic identity. No accounts. No tracking. No IP logging. You own your keys — they live in your browser, never on our server.

Anyone can host a server. Servers are meeting places, not gatekeepers. Your identity is portable across all of them. A tiered trust system (verified + Accord adoption) helps users find reliable communities.

**What's built and live:**
- E2E encrypted DMs — ECDH P-256 + AES-256-GCM, server never sees plaintext
- Channels, groups (foundation), threaded replies
- Voice & video calling — WebRTC P2P with audio, video, screen share, PiP, camera selection
- Persistent voice channels — always-on WebRTC mesh rooms
- Message search — full-text search across conversations
- Follow/friend system (mutual follow = friends)
- Friend codes — 8-character codes, 24-hour expiry, auto-mutual-follow
- Device management — list, label, and revoke linked keys
- User profiles with bio and social links, identicons
- @mentions, persistent emoji reactions, message editing, image sharing
- Browse tab — web directory with 52 sites, Tranco ranks, RDAP domain info, uptime pings, collections, 4 sort modes
- Dashboard tab — 10 widget types, customizable drag-and-drop layout
- Project board (kanban), marketplace (P2P listings, kiosks, 3D model subcategories, donation pricing)
- Asset library — file upload (drag-drop), browse by category, grid/list views, tags, search, preview modal
- Universal catalog — 118 elements, 44 materials, processing chains
- Personal inventory, notes, todos, garden tracker
- Fantasy tab (character sheet, lore, world map, achievements)
- Streaming system — PiP compositing, admin-only relay streaming, unified chat with Twitch IRC, viewer interface, stream stats, stream history
- Video calling with camera, screen share, PiP, camera selection, gallery view
- Key backup/export/import, encrypted user data sync
- PWA installable on mobile
- Desktop app — Tauri v2 with auto-updater (Windows, macOS ARM64 + x64, Linux)
- Settings panel (accent colors, font size, themes), command palette
- Auto-reload on deploy, auto-login
- Notification sounds (6 options), browser notifications
- Pin system (server + personal), blocking, reporting
- Admin/mod tools, lockdown, invite codes, rate limiting
- Security hardened: CSP, HSTS, TLS 1.2+, upload validation
- Federation Phase 1 — server discovery, trust tiers
- Federation Phase 2 — cross-server identity and room directory
- 11 hub tabs: Chat, Board, Reality, Fantasy, Market, Browse, Dashboard, Streams, Info, Source, Debug

**What's designed (building next):**
- Native game client (Rust)
- Content-addressed file sharing

## The Mission

**End poverty by building capability.**

Not through handouts or programs, but through knowledge and tools that anyone can access, anywhere, forever.

This is a long game. I might not see it finished. But I can lay foundations that others can build on.

That's what I'm here to do.
