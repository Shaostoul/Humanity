# Get Involved

This is an open project. It belongs to everyone. Here's how you can help.

---

## Talk to Us

**The fastest way to get involved is to show up.**

**[united-humanity.us/chat](https://united-humanity.us/chat)** — Our live chat. No account needed. No tracking. Ed25519 cryptographic identity, encrypted by design. Just open the link and say hello.

**[Discord](https://discord.gg/9XxmmeQnWC)** — Longer-form discussion, community coordination, and voice chat.

## Contribute

**Writers & Editors**
The Accord and documentation need clear, accessible language. Help us refine ideas into words that work.

**Designers & Artists**
Project Universe needs concept art, UI design, 3D models, and visual identity.

**Developers**
The server is built in Rust (axum + tokio). The client is single-file HTML/JS. The desktop app uses Tauri v2. If you can code in Rust, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, or TypeScript — there's work to do.

**Current technical needs:**
- WebRTC streaming infrastructure
- Federation protocol improvements
- Game client development (Rust)
- UI/UX refinements across all 11 hub tabs
- Testing and bug reports

**Subject Matter Experts**
Homesteading, agriculture, construction, medicine, engineering — if you know how to do something useful, we want to teach it.

**Translators**
Humanity speaks many languages. The mission should too.

Attention is a resource. Help us earn it.

## The Long Game

This isn't a startup looking for an exit.
This isn't a product looking for customers.
This is a foundation looking for builders.

We're not racing. We're laying groundwork for something that could outlast all of us.

If that resonates, welcome. Let's build.
