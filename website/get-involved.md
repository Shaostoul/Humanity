# Get Involved

This is an open project. It belongs to everyone. Here's how you can help.

---

## Contribute

**Writers & Editors**  
The Accord and documentation need clear, accessible language. Help us refine ideas into words that work.

**Designers & Artists**  
Project Universe needs concept art, UI design, 3D models, and visual identity.

**Developers**  
The game engine will be built in Rust. Tooling may use Python. If you can code, there's work to do.

**Subject Matter Experts**  
Homesteading, agriculture, construction, medicine, engineering—if you know how to do something useful, we want to teach it.

**Translators**  
Humanity speaks many languages. The mission should too.

2. **Explore the repo** — see what exists, what's planned

## Donate

This project is built by volunteers, but infrastructure costs money.

If you believe in the mission and want to help keep it running:

- **Ko-fi:** [ko-fi.com/shaostoul](https://ko-fi.com/shaostoul)
- **GitHub Sponsors:** [github.com/sponsors/Shaostoul](https://github.com/sponsors/Shaostoul)

Every dollar goes toward development, hosting, and keeping the team fed while we build.

## Spread the Word

Not everyone can contribute time or money. But you can share.

- Tell a friend who might care
- Post about it on social media
- Link to the project from your own work

Attention is a resource. Help us earn it.

## The Long Game

This isn't a startup looking for exit.  
This isn't a product looking for customers.  
This is a foundation looking for builders.

We're not racing. We're laying groundwork for something that could outlast all of us.

If that resonates, welcome. Let's build.
