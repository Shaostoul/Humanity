# Project Status

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Current Phase: Live Platform

The chat and hub are **operational and in daily use** at [united-humanity.us/chat](https://united-humanity.us/chat). We're past spec phase — this is a real platform people use.

## What's Built

### Communication
- ✅ Channels (public rooms)
- ✅ E2E encrypted DMs — ECDH P-256 + AES-256-GCM, server never sees plaintext
- ✅ Groups (private group conversations)
- ✅ Voice & video calling — WebRTC P2P with camera, screen share, PiP, camera selection
- ✅ Persistent voice channels — always-on WebRTC mesh rooms
- ✅ Message search — full-text search across conversations
- ✅ @mentions, persistent emoji reactions, message editing
- ✅ Image sharing and file uploads
- ✅ Browser notifications with 6 sound options
- ✅ Pin system — server pins + personal pins

### Social System
- ✅ Follow/friend system (mutual follow = friends)
- ✅ Friend codes — 8-character codes, 24-hour expiry, auto-mutual-follow
- ✅ User profiles with bio and social links
- ✅ Identicons (generated avatars)
- ✅ Device management — list, label, and revoke linked keys
- ✅ Blocking and reporting

### Hub Tools (11 tabs total)
- ✅ Project board (kanban task management)
- ✅ Marketplace — P2P listings, kiosks, 3D model subcategories, donation pricing
- ✅ Asset library — file upload (drag-drop), browse by category, grid/list views, tags, search, preview modal
- ✅ Universal catalog (elements, materials, processing chains)
- ✅ Browse tab — web directory with 52 sites, Tranco ranks, RDAP, uptime pings, collections
- ✅ Dashboard tab — 10 widget types, customizable drag-and-drop layout
- ✅ Personal inventory tracker
- ✅ Notes (private)

- ✅ Garden tracker v2 — 5 growing methods, 12 metrics, optimal ranges

### Game & Creative
- ✅ Fantasy tab — character sheet, lore, world map, achievements
- ✅ Streams tab — local capture demo
- ✅ Concept art for in-game spaces (spaceships, virtual malls)

### Platform & Security
- ✅ Cryptographic identity (Ed25519) — no accounts, no passwords
- ✅ Key backup/export/import
- ✅ Encrypted user data sync — AES-256-GCM derived from private key
- ✅ PWA — installable on mobile
- ✅ Desktop app — Tauri v2 with auto-updater (Windows, macOS ARM64 + x64, Linux)
- ✅ Settings panel — accent colors, font size, themes
- ✅ Command palette
- ✅ Auto-reload on deploy, auto-login
- ✅ Admin/mod tools, lockdown, invite codes
- ✅ Rate limiting, upload validation, CSP headers, TLS 1.2+, HSTS
- ✅ Server federation Phase 1 — discovery, trust tiers
- ✅ Federation Phase 2 — server-to-server WebSocket with Ed25519 handshake

### Documentation
- ✅ Humanity Accord (civilizational framework)
- ✅ Full technical design specs
