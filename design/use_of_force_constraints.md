# Use of Force Constraints

## Purpose

This document defines non-negotiable constraints governing the use,
delegation, and limitation of force under the Humanity Framework.

Force is treated as a failure mode of coordination.
Its use is constrained to prevent domination, abuse, and escalation.

---

## Core Principle

The legitimacy of force derives solely from its role
in preventing greater harm when peaceful mechanisms fail.

Force is never a first solution.
Force is never a substitute for governance.
Force is never a tool of convenience.

---

## Right to Self-Defense

### 1. Preservation of Agency

Humans retain the right to defend themselves
against immediate and unlawful coercion, violence, or domination.

This right exists to prevent helplessness,
not to grant authority over others.

---

### 2. Resistance to Domination

No authority may maintain power
through exclusive control of force
without accountability and consent.

Systems that render populations defenseless
while concentrating force elsewhere
are structurally tyrannical.

---

## Constraints on Use of Force

### 3. Proportionality

Force must be:
- proportional to the threat
- limited in scope
- constrained in duration

Excessive force invalidates legitimacy.

---

### 4. Necessity

Force is permissible only when:
- peaceful alternatives have failed or are unavailable
- delay would result in irreparable harm

Force used for punishment, deterrence through fear,
or symbolic dominance is illegitimate.

---

### 5. Discrimination

Force must:
- distinguish between aggressors and non-aggressors
- minimize harm to uninvolved parties
- preserve human dignity even in conflict

Indiscriminate force is forbidden.

---

## Collective Force and Authority

### 6. Conditional Delegation

Communities may delegate force
only under explicit, limited, and revocable authority.

Delegated force must:
- have defined scope
- have defined oversight
- be subject to recall

Permanent or unaccountable force structures are invalid.

---

### 7. Transparency and Accountability

Use of force must be:
- observable
- documented
- reviewable

Secret force is incompatible with legitimacy.

---

## Weapons and Technology Neutrality

### 8. No Technology Fetishism

This framework does not guarantee access to any specific weapon.

Constraints apply regardless of:
- weapon type
- technological era
- delivery mechanism

What matters is impact, not implementation.

---

### 9. Prevention of Asymmetry

Force structures must not create
irreversible asymmetries of power
between authority and population.

When asymmetry exists,
additional accountability is required.

---

## De-escalation and Repair

### 10. Preference for De-escalation

Systems must prioritize:
- containment over destruction
- de-escalation over escalation
- restoration over retaliation

Force that increases future conflict
fails its purpose.

---

### 11. Repair After Force

After force is used:
- harm must be acknowledged
- responsibility must be assigned
- repair must be attempted
- conditions that led to force must be corrected

Normalization of force is a civilizational failure.

---

## Prohibited Uses of Force

Force must never be used:
- to suppress dissent
- to enforce belief or ideology
- to maintain power through fear
- to compensate for governance failure

Force used to preserve domination
invalidates all claims of legitimacy.

---

## Enforcement

Any system or authority that violates these constraints:
- forfeits moral and civil legitimacy
- must be constrained, reformed, or dismantled

Stability built on coercion is temporary.
Peace built on restraint endures.

---

## Relationship to Other Documents

- Ethical Principles define the moral basis of restraint.
- Rights and Responsibilities define human protections.
- Governance Models define authority limits.
- Safety and Responsibility define harm constraints.

---

## Summary

Force exists to prevent domination,
not to impose it.

A society that requires constant force to function
has already failed to govern.

Restraint is strength.
