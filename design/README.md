# design/README.md

This folder defines the **authoritative technical law** of Humanity.

Where the Humanity Accord defines human principles, this folder defines how those principles are enforced through structure, constraint, and determinism.

Documents here are written for builders, maintainers, and systems.
They are binding.

## How to Use This Folder

- For authority boundaries and flow: `architecture.md`
- For simulation truth constraints: `simulation_laws.md` and `realism_constraints.md`
- For data representation rules: `data_model.md`
- For system behavior specs: `systems/`
- For data shape contracts: `schemas/`
- For tests as truth enforcement: `testing_philosophy.md`
- For bounded AI assistance rules: `ai_interface.md`
- For asset non-authority rules: `asset_rules.md`

Design must comply with `accord_constraints.md`.

## Canonical Design Documents

### Foundational Design Law (root)

- **DESIGN.md**  
  Design as binding technical law.

- **accord_constraints.md**  
  How the Humanity Accord constrains design and implementation.

- **architecture.md**  
  Authority separation, data flow, and execution structure.

- **simulation_laws.md**  
  Determinism, causality, time progression, and conservation rules.

- **realism_constraints.md**  
  Reality-first constraints and acceptable abstraction limits.

- **data_model.md**  
  Rules governing how reality is represented as structured data.

- **economy_model.md**  
  Material, energy, labor, and time flow constraints.

- **education_model.md**  
  How learning is represented and validated at a system level.

- **ai_interface.md**  
  AI authority limits, access rules, and failure handling.

- **asset_rules.md**  
  Constraints on models, textures, audio, and other assets.

- **testing_philosophy.md**  
  What correctness means and how it is verified.

- **system_inventory.md**  
  Non-binding catalog of candidate systems and their boundaries.

- **terminology.md**  
  Technical terms used across design and simulation.

## System Specifications (`systems/`)

Each file defines a **bounded system** and must obey foundational design law.

Examples (not exhaustive):
- construction
- farming
- health
- energy
- storage
- transport
- ecology
- population

---

## Data Schemas (`schemas/`)

Schemas define **data shape contracts** consumed by systems.

Expected categories:
- entities
- resources
- structures
- processes
- events

Schemas define structure and invariants, not behavior.

## Relationship to Other Folders

- `accord/` defines human principles and ethics
- `design/` defines enforceable system law
- `knowledge/` provides real-world references
- `data/` contains canonical structured truth
- `engine/` executes design deterministically

Design translates meaning into machinery.
