# economy_model.md — Scarcity, Labor, and Distribution

This document defines the **economic model** of Project Universe. Economy here is not currency-first; it is **material flow under constraint**. Poverty is modeled as a systemic failure of access, knowledge, time, and distribution—not as a lack of points.

This model is subordinate only to philosophy and `realism_constraints.md` and must comply with `simulation_laws.md`, `data_model.md`, and `education_model.md`.

## 1. Economic principles

1. **Scarcity is real** — resources are finite in time and space.
2. **Labor is primary** — value originates from time, effort, and skill.
3. **Production precedes exchange** — nothing is traded before it exists.
4. **Distribution matters** — misallocation causes poverty even amid abundance.
5. **Failure is instructive** — economic collapse has explainable causes.

## 2. Economic layers

### 2.1 Physical economy (base layer)

The physical economy tracks:

* matter flows (inputs, outputs, waste)
* energy flows (work, losses)
* time allocation

All higher economic layers must reconcile with the physical layer.

---

### 2.2 Labor economy

Labor is modeled explicitly:

* finite hours per entity
* fatigue and recovery
* skill-modified efficiency (bounded)

Rules:

* One unit of labor cannot be used twice.
* Skill reduces waste and error, not time to zero.

---

### 2.3 Knowledge economy

Knowledge affects:

* planning accuracy
* failure rates
* resource utilization

Knowledge does not:

* create resources
* remove labor requirements

---

### 2.4 Exchange economy

Exchange mechanisms include:

* barter
* shared storage
* mediated trade (currency, credits)

Exchange never violates physical or labor constraints.

---

## 3. Value definition

### 3.1 Use value

Value is first defined by **use**:

* sustenance
* shelter
* tools
* stability

An item with no use has no inherent value.

---

### 3.2 Labor-embedded value

Value increases with:

* labor invested
* skill required
* time delayed

This value is contextual, not absolute.

---

### 3.3 Market value (derived)

Market value:

* emerges from scarcity and demand
* fluctuates
* is never authoritative over physical constraints

---

## 4. Poverty modeling

Poverty is defined as **persistent inability to meet essential needs** despite available effort.

### 4.1 Causes of poverty

Modeled causes include:

* lack of access to resources
* insufficient knowledge
* time traps (overwork with low return)
* distribution bottlenecks
* environmental constraints

---

### 4.2 Poverty indicators

Indicators tracked:

* unmet caloric needs
* inadequate shelter
* unsustainable labor load
* recurring failure loops

---

### 4.3 Poverty feedback loops

Negative loops:

* fatigue → errors → lower yield → more labor
* spoilage → scarcity → hoarding → further spoilage

Breaking loops requires systemic change, not rewards.

---

## 5. Production systems

### 5.1 Primary production

* agriculture
* animal husbandry
* resource gathering

Outputs depend on:

* environment
* labor
* skill
* time

---

### 5.2 Secondary production

* processing
* manufacturing
* construction

Adds durability, usability, or longevity at cost.

---

### 5.3 Maintenance economy

Neglect incurs debt:

* tools degrade
* structures fail
* productivity drops

Maintenance is mandatory and consumes resources.

---

## 6. Distribution systems

### 6.1 Storage

Storage mediates time:

* buffers abundance and scarcity
* introduces spoilage risk

---

### 6.2 Transport

Transport mediates space:

* costs energy and time
* introduces loss risk

---

### 6.3 Allocation

Allocation choices:

* determine survival outcomes
* reflect governance and culture

---

## 7. Currency and abstraction

### 7.1 Currency role

Currency:

* simplifies exchange
* does not create value

---

### 7.2 Inflation and distortion

Inflation occurs when:

* currency grows faster than production

Currency systems that decouple from production create instability.

---

## 8. Cooperation and specialization

### 8.1 Cooperation benefits

Cooperation enables:

* specialization
* risk sharing
* efficiency gains

---

### 8.2 Specialization limits

Specialization introduces fragility:

* dependency chains
* failure cascades

Balanced generalism improves resilience.

---

## 9. Economic failure modes

Explicit failure cases include:

* starvation amid surplus
* collapse due to maintenance neglect
* trade dependency collapse
* labor exhaustion

Each failure must:

* have identifiable causes
* have possible mitigations

---

## 10. Education and economy

Economic understanding is teachable:

* cost-benefit analysis
* opportunity cost
* planning under constraint

Education systems surface:

* why choices succeeded or failed
* which constraints dominated

---

## 11. AI boundaries

AI may:

* explain economic outcomes
* visualize flows
* suggest alternatives

AI may not:

* optimize beyond constraints
* invent resources
* guarantee outcomes

---

## 12. Validation rules

The build must fail if:

* resources appear without production
* labor is double-counted
* exchange violates physical constraints
* poverty states lack causal explanation

---

## 13. Design intent restated

The economic model exists to:

* make poverty understandable
* make cooperation meaningful
* reward planning, not exploitation

There is no winning the economy.

There is only sustaining life under reality.
