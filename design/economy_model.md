## Purpose

This document defines how economic reality is modeled as a **system of constrained flows**, not as abstract numbers or optimization games.

The economy exists to satisfy human needs under finite conditions:
- limited resources
- limited energy
- limited time
- limited labor

Economic design prioritizes stability, dignity, and continuity over maximization.

---

## Foundational Premise

Poverty is not a moral failure.  
It is a systemic failure.

An economy that produces widespread deprivation under known constraints is improperly designed.

---

## Core Economic Quantities

The economy is modeled using concrete, conserved quantities:

- material
- energy
- labor time
- skill and competence
- infrastructure capacity

All quantities:
- are finite
- have acquisition costs
- impose opportunity tradeoffs

No quantity is infinite or free.

---

## Labor and Time

Human labor is embodied and finite.

Economic systems must:
- respect physical and cognitive limits
- account for rest and recovery
- prevent extraction that degrades agency

Systems that rely on exhaustion or coercion are invalid.

---

## Production and Consumption

Production transforms inputs into outputs under constraint.

Consumption represents irreversible use.

Economic design must:
- surface true costs
- expose dependencies
- make waste visible

Hidden externalization of cost constitutes harm.

---

## Scarcity and Allocation

Scarcity is real and unavoidable.

Ethical allocation:
- minimizes preventable harm
- prioritizes basic needs
- avoids concentration through domination

Scarcity does not justify exploitation.

---

## Feedback and Failure

Economic systems must include feedback loops.

Indicators of failure include:
- unmet basic needs
- systemic dependency
- irreversible loss
- concentration of power

Failure must be detectable and correctable.

---

## Growth and Expansion

Growth is not assumed.

Expansion is valid only when:
- underlying systems remain stable
- ecological limits are respected
- future viability is preserved

Short-term gain that degrades long-term capacity is invalid.

---

## Repair and Resilience

Economic systems must support:
- recovery from shocks
- redistribution under failure
- repair of infrastructure and trust

Irreversible economic punishment undermines cooperation.

---

## Transparency

All economic mechanisms must be:
- inspectable
- explainable
- auditable

Opaque economies concentrate power and erode trust.

---

## Closing Statement

An economy is not a scoreboard.

It is a living system whose purpose is to allow humans to live, learn, and contribute without degradation.

Economic design succeeds when dignity remains intact under stress.
