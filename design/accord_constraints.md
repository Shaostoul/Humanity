# Accord Constraints

## Purpose

This document defines how the Humanity Accord constrains design, systems, and implementation.

It exists to translate human-facing principles into enforceable technical obligations without reinterpretation, dilution, or omission.

Design does not invent values.
Design operationalizes them.

---

## Authority Relationship

The Humanity Accord is the highest authority.

All design documents, systems, schemas, data, and implementations:

* inherit constraints from the Accord
* may not contradict Accord principles
* may not redefine ethical meaning

Where ambiguity exists, interpretation must err toward:

* protection of dignity
* reduction of harm
* preservation of agency

---

## Constraint Categories

Accord constraints apply across multiple dimensions of design.

They are grouped here for clarity, not hierarchy.

---

## Dignity Constraints

Derived from:

* Humanity Accord
* Ethical Principles
* Harm and Responsibility

Design must:

* avoid mechanics that require humiliation or degradation
* avoid systems that normalize exploitation
* ensure individuals are never treated solely as resources

Any system requiring routine dignity violation is invalid by design.

---

## Non-Domination Constraints

Derived from:

* Ethical Principles
* Governance Models

Design must:

* avoid irreversible power concentration
* provide meaningful recourse and exit paths
* make authority scopes explicit and limited

Hidden or unchallengeable authority constitutes domination.

---

## Consent Constraints

Derived from:

* Ethical Principles
* Harm and Responsibility

Design must:

* avoid coercive progression
* avoid forced participation through deprivation
* ensure participation is informed and reversible where possible

Systems that remove choice under threat invalidate consent.

---

## Transparency Constraints

Derived from:

* Humanity Accord
* Knowledge Sources

Design must:

* make system logic inspectable
* expose cause-and-effect relationships
* avoid deceptive presentation or dark patterns

Opacity is permitted only where it prevents harm and must be documented.

---

## Harm Minimization Constraints

Derived from:

* Harm and Responsibility
* Conflict Resolution

Design must:

* surface foreseeable harm
* prefer reversible failure over irreversible loss
* provide warning before catastrophic outcomes

Predictable harm without mitigation is a design failure.

---

## Repair-First Constraints

Derived from:

* Ethical Principles
* Conflict Resolution

Design must:

* prioritize recovery paths over permanent punishment
* allow learning from failure
* avoid systems that trap individuals in irrecoverable states

Irreversibility requires explicit justification.

---

## Power-Asymmetry Constraints

Derived from:

* Ethical Principles
* Harm and Responsibility

Design must:

* scale responsibility with power
* expose leverage and influence
* prevent abuse through asymmetry

Neutral design in asymmetric contexts favors harm.

---

## Epistemic Integrity Constraints

Derived from:

* Scope Boundaries
* Knowledge Sources

Design must:

* distinguish reality, model, and fiction
* label abstractions clearly
* prevent speculative systems from masquerading as fact

Confusion between domains undermines trust and learning.

---

## Human Needs Alignment

Derived from:

* Human Needs

Design must:

* respect survival, agency, and meaning
* avoid systems that require chronic deprivation
* ensure progress does not undermine basic needs

Systems optimized against human needs are unstable.

---

## Conflict Constraints

Derived from:

* Conflict Resolution

Design must:

* provide non-violent resolution mechanisms
* avoid incentivizing domination
* make escalation proportional and reviewable

Violence is containment of last resort, not a mechanic.

---

## Design Review Obligations

All major design decisions must document:

* which Accord principles apply
* what tradeoffs are accepted
* what harms are possible
* how correction is enabled

Silence is not neutrality.

---

## Evolution and Revision

Accord constraints are stable but not immutable.

Design updates may:

* refine enforcement
* improve clarity
* reduce harm

Design updates may not:

* bypass Accord principles
* redefine ethical meaning
* introduce domination through convenience

---

## Closing Statement

The Accord defines what humanity refuses to sacrifice.

Design exists to make those refusals operational.

Any system that cannot uphold the Accord must be redesigned—or not built.
