# Architecture Decisions

## Purpose
This folder contains Architecture Decision Records.
Each record captures a major system decision so future contributors can understand:
- why the decision was made
- what constraints it satisfies
- what tradeoffs it introduces
- what alternatives were rejected and why

## Rules
- One decision per file.
- Use stable language. Avoid implementation details that will churn.
- If a decision changes, create a new record that supersedes the old one. Do not rewrite history.

## Template
Each decision record must include:
- Context
- Decision
- Status
- Consequences
- Rejected alternatives
- Follow-up tasks
