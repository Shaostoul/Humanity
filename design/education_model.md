# education_model.md — Learning as a First-Class System

This document defines **how learning, skill acquisition, assessment, and knowledge transfer work** in Project Universe.

Education is not content delivery. Education is **measurable capability change under constraint**.

This model exists to ensure the game teaches reality, not memorization or grind.

## 1. Educational principles

1. **Learning requires action** — knowledge without practice is incomplete.
2. **Failure is instructional** — mistakes are data, not punishment.
3. **Mastery is gradual** — expertise emerges over time under varied conditions.
4. **Context matters** — skills are domain- and environment-sensitive.
5. **Transfer is limited** — learning in one domain only partially applies to others.

## 2. Knowledge types

Project Universe distinguishes multiple kinds of knowledge:

### 2.1 Declarative knowledge ("knowing that")

* Facts, concepts, definitions
* Examples: soil pH ranges, nutrient names

Stored in:

* `education/concepts/`
* `data/glossaries/`

---

### 2.2 Procedural knowledge ("knowing how")

* Step-by-step practices
* Examples: planting seeds, preserving food

Stored in:

* `data/practices/`
* `education/lessons/`

---

### 2.3 Experiential knowledge ("knowing when")

* Judgment under uncertainty
* Pattern recognition
* Tradeoff evaluation

Emerges from:

* repeated action
* varied conditions
* failure analysis

---

## 3. Skills

### 3.1 Skill definition

A skill represents **reduced error and waste**, not superhuman ability.

Skills:

* do not bypass constraints
* do not remove time costs
* do not guarantee success

---

### 3.2 Skill levels

Skill progression is continuous, not discrete tiers.

Effects of skill increase:

* narrower error margins
* reduced resource waste
* improved diagnosis of failure
* better planning accuracy

---

### 3.3 Skill decay

* Unused skills decay slowly.
* Decay represents loss of precision, not loss of basic knowledge.

---

## 4. Learning mechanisms

### 4.1 Practice-based learning

* Performing actions contributes to learning.
* Learning rate depends on:

  * task difficulty
  * current skill
  * environmental stress

---

### 4.2 Instruction-based learning

* Mentors, manuals, and lessons accelerate learning.
* Instruction cannot replace practice.

---

### 4.3 Observation-based learning

* Observing others provides partial learning.
* Observation is less effective than direct action.

---

## 5. Failure-driven education

### 5.1 Failure analysis

When failure occurs, the system records:

* triggering conditions
* violated constraints
* incorrect assumptions

These feed:

* educational prompts
* mentor dialogue
* assessment generation

---

### 5.2 Safe failure

* Early learning environments allow reversible failure.
* Advanced environments enforce full consequences.

---

## 6. Assessments

### 6.1 Assessment types

Assessments measure capability, not memory:

* Outcome-based (Did the crop survive?)
* Process-based (Were steps followed?)
* Diagnostic (Can the cause be identified?)

---

### 6.2 Assessment validity

An assessment is valid only if:

* it reflects real constraints
* success cannot be faked
* failure provides explanation

---

## 7. Apprenticeships

### 7.1 Long-form learning

Apprenticeships:

* span long durations
* expose learners to variability
* require sustained performance

---

### 7.2 Mentor role

Mentors:

* explain observed outcomes
* suggest corrective actions
* cannot override constraints

---

## 8. Knowledge transfer limits

* Skills are domain-specific.
* Transfer between domains is partial.

Example:

* Farming skill partially transfers to gardening, not to metallurgy.

---

## 9. Educational pacing

* Learning speed is bounded.
* Skipping prerequisites increases failure rate.

---

## 10. AI in education

AI may:

* explain failures
* summarize lessons
* highlight constraints

AI may not:

* grant knowledge
* bypass practice
* accelerate mastery beyond bounds

---

## 11. Validation rules

The build must fail if:

* skills bypass constraints
* learning occurs without action or instruction
* assessments can be gamed

---

## 12. Design intent restated

Education in Project Universe exists to:

* build real competence
* encourage experimentation
* normalize failure as feedback

Learning is not a reward track. It is the core loop.
