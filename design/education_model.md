## Purpose

This document defines how learning and competence are represented and validated within the system.

Education is treated as **capability development**, not information transfer.

The goal is to produce understanding that survives contact with reality.

---

## Foundational Premise

Knowledge without application is fragile.

Understanding emerges through:
- action
- consequence
- reflection
- correction

Education must remain grounded in reality and feedback.

---

## Learning Representation

Learning is represented as:
- demonstrated competence
- repeatable outcomes
- transferable understanding

Learning is not represented as:
- abstract completion
- symbolic progression
- irreversible unlocks

---

## Skill Acquisition

Skills develop through:
- practice under constraint
- exposure to variation
- failure and correction

Progression is non-linear.

Regression is possible and expected.

---

## Knowledge Transfer

Knowledge transfer must:
- preserve causality
- expose assumptions
- distinguish models from reality

Magical or instantaneous knowledge transfer is invalid.

---

## Failure as Feedback

Failure is informational.

Educational systems must:
- allow failure
- explain causes
- enable retry
- avoid punitive lockout

Failure without explanation is harm.

---

## Assessment

Assessment evaluates:
- capability
- understanding
- judgment under constraint

Assessment does not evaluate:
- conformity
- speed alone
- symbolic completion

---

## Interdisciplinary Learning

Reality is interconnected.

Educational systems must:
- link disciplines
- expose tradeoffs
- prevent siloed understanding

Understanding improves at boundaries.

---

## AI and Assistance

AI may assist education by:
- explaining outcomes
- highlighting constraints
- comparing scenarios

AI may not:
- bypass learning
- replace competence
- fabricate understanding

---

## Transparency

Learners must be able to see:
- why outcomes occurred
- what rules applied
- what data mattered

Hidden grading or progression undermines trust.

---

## Closing Statement

Education succeeds when humans can act competently in unfamiliar conditions.

Learning that only functions in controlled environments is incomplete.
