# DESIGN.md

## Purpose

This document defines what **design** means within Humanity.

Design is binding technical law.  
It translates human principles into enforceable structure.

Design does not describe aspirations.  
Design defines what is allowed, what is constrained, and what is forbidden.

---

## Authority

Design inherits authority from the Humanity Accord.

All design documents are constrained by:
- human dignity
- non-domination
- harm minimization
- transparency
- repair-first responsibility

These constraints are formally defined in:
- `design/accord_constraints.md`

No design decision may bypass or reinterpret those constraints.

---

## Role of Design

Design exists to ensure that:

- reality is modeled honestly
- causality is explicit
- systems are understandable
- power is bounded
- failure is visible and correctable

Design is the layer where ambiguity is removed.

---

## What Design Is

Design is:
- deterministic
- inspectable
- testable
- constrained
- explainable

Design defines:
- how systems behave
- how data is interpreted
- how time advances
- how failure manifests

---

## What Design Is Not

Design is not:
- narrative
- ideology
- aspiration
- persuasion
- entertainment framing

Design does not:
- define ethics
- define values
- define meaning

Those belong to the Accord.

---

## Relationship to Other Design Documents

- `design/README.md` defines scope and structure
- `accord_constraints.md` defines ethical and human limits
- `architecture.md` defines authority separation and execution flow
- system documents define bounded behavior
- schemas define data shape

DESIGN.md exists to assert **design as law**, not to enumerate content.

---

## Closing Statement

Good design prevents abuse by making abuse impossible to hide.

Design is restraint applied deliberately, so freedom remains real.
