# realism_constraints.md — Non‑Negotiable Reality Limits

This document defines the **hard constraints of reality** enforced by Project Universe.

These constraints are **absolute**. They outrank all other design documents except philosophy. Any system, mechanic, mod, asset, UI, narrative, or AI output that violates these constraints is invalid.

The purpose is not difficulty. The purpose is **truth preservation**.

---

## 1. Constraint philosophy

1. Reality has limits.
2. Limits create meaning.
3. Learning requires consequence.
4. Consequence requires failure.

Project Universe does not simulate fantasy. It simulates *life under constraint*.

---

## 2. Conservation laws

### 2.1 Matter conservation

* Matter cannot be created or destroyed.
* Transformations must account for:

  * inputs
  * outputs
  * byproducts
  * waste

Violations:

* Creating items from nothing
* Disappearing waste without a sink

---

### 2.2 Energy conservation

* Energy inputs must cover energy outputs and losses.
* Perpetual motion systems are forbidden.

Examples:

* Food calories → human labor
* Fuel → heat + work
* Electricity → work + waste heat

---

### 2.3 Nutritional conservation

* Calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients must balance.
* Deficiencies accumulate over time.
* Excess does not eliminate deficiency elsewhere.

---

## 3. Time constraints

### 3.1 Time is non‑compressible

* Processes take real time.
* Skill does not eliminate time, only waste.

Forbidden:

* Instant growth
* Zero‑time crafting

---

### 3.2 Parallel labor limits

* A human can perform only one focused task at a time.
* Multitasking increases error and fatigue.

---

## 4. Biological constraints

### 4.1 Human limits

* Humans require:

  * water
  * calories
  * rest
  * shelter
* Ignoring needs causes degradation, not stasis.

---

### 4.2 Fatigue and injury

* Labor causes fatigue.
* Fatigue increases error rate.
* Injury reduces capacity and requires recovery time.

---

### 4.3 Skill realism

* Skills reduce error and waste.
* Skills do not create impossible outcomes.

Example:

* No skill allows farming without water.

---

## 5. Ecological constraints

### 5.1 Soil limits

* Soil nutrients deplete.
* Soil recovers only through known processes (rotation, composting, time).

---

### 5.2 Climate dependence

* Temperature and seasonality affect growth and survival.
* Environments cannot be ignored.

---

### 5.3 Biodiversity effects

* Monoculture increases failure risk.
* Diversity increases resilience, not yield certainty.

---

## 6. Mechanical constraints

### 6.1 Wear and degradation

* Tools and machines degrade with use.
* Maintenance consumes time and materials.

---

### 6.2 Load and stress

* Structures have load limits.
* Exceeding limits causes damage or collapse.

---

## 7. Storage and preservation constraints

### 7.1 Spoilage

* Food spoils unless preserved.
* Preservation methods trade time, energy, and nutrients.

---

### 7.2 Storage conditions

* Temperature, humidity, and pests affect stored goods.

---

## 8. Knowledge constraints

### 8.1 Knowledge is learned

* Knowledge must be acquired through education, practice, or observation.
* No spontaneous knowledge acquisition.

---

### 8.2 Teaching limits

* Teaching requires time and capable teachers.
* Learners progress at bounded rates.

---

## 9. Economic constraints

### 9.1 Scarcity

* Resources are finite at any given time and place.

---

### 9.2 Labor value

* Labor has opportunity cost.
* Time spent producing one thing cannot produce another.

---

## 10. Spatial constraints

### 10.1 Space is finite

* Homesteads, ships, and structures have bounded volume and area.

---

### 10.2 Transport cost

* Moving mass costs time and energy.

---

## 11. Information constraints

### 11.1 No omniscience

* Players and NPCs only know what they have learned or observed.

---

### 11.2 Uncertainty

* Measurements have error.
* Outcomes have variance within bounded models.

---

## 12. AI constraints

### 12.1 AI is advisory

* AI may explain systems.
* AI may interpret state.
* AI may not override simulation.

---

### 12.2 Low‑power requirement

* The game must function fully without AI.
* AI is an optional interpreter, not a dependency.

---

## 13. Enforcement rules

A build must fail if:

* Any mechanic violates a conservation law.
* Any process lacks declared time cost.
* Any definition lacks failure cases.
* Any system creates resources without inputs.

---

## 14. Design intent restated

These constraints exist to ensure:

* poverty is understood systemically
* effort matters
* cooperation is meaningful
* knowledge has weight

Reality is not optional.

---

## 15. Summary (non‑exhaustive)

* No free matter.
* No free energy.
* No free time.
* No free knowledge.
* No free labor.
* No free space.

Only tradeoffs.
