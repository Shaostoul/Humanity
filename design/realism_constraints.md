# realism_constraints.md

## Purpose

This document defines non-negotiable reality constraints.

These constraints preserve:
- truth
- consequence
- learning integrity
- resistance to domination through abstraction

They apply to all systems, data, assets, tools, and explanations.

---

## Authority

These constraints derive authority from:
- the Humanity Accord
- `design/accord_constraints.md`

No design decision may violate these constraints for convenience.

---

## Conservation Laws

### Matter

Matter cannot be created or destroyed.

All transformations must account for:
- inputs
- outputs
- byproducts
- waste

---

### Energy

Energy must balance.

No perpetual motion.
No free work.

---

### Nutrition

Calories and nutrients must balance over time.

Deficiencies accumulate.
Excess does not substitute.

---

## Time Constraints

Time is non-compressible.

Processes take time.
Skill reduces waste, not duration.

Parallel labor is limited by human capacity.

---

## Biological Constraints

Humans require:
- water
- calories
- rest
- shelter

Ignoring needs causes degradation.

Fatigue increases error.
Injury reduces capacity.

---

## Ecological Constraints

Soil depletes.
Climate matters.
Biodiversity affects resilience.

Recovery requires known processes and time.

---

## Mechanical Constraints

Tools degrade.
Structures have load limits.
Maintenance consumes resources.

Ignoring wear causes failure.

---

## Storage Constraints

Food spoils.
Preservation trades time, energy, and nutrients.

Storage conditions matter.

---

## Knowledge Constraints

Knowledge is learned, not granted.

Teaching consumes time.
Understanding progresses at bounded rates.

No omniscience.

---

## Economic Constraints

Scarcity is real.
Labor has opportunity cost.

Every choice excludes others.

---

## Spatial Constraints

Space is finite.
Transport costs time and energy.

Distance matters.

---

## Information Constraints

Measurements have error.
Outcomes vary within bounded models.

Uncertainty must be surfaced.

---

## AI Constraints

AI may explain and analyze.
AI may not override simulation or constraints.

The system must function without AI.

---

## Enforcement

A system is invalid if it:
- creates resources without inputs
- removes consequences
- hides failure
- violates conservation

---

## Closing Statement

Reality is not optional.

Constraints create meaning.
Meaning enables learning.
