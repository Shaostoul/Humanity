# simulation_laws.md

## Purpose

This document defines the laws governing simulation, causality, and time.

These laws ensure that outcomes arise from:
- explicit state
- explicit rules
- explicit passage of time

The simulation exists to preserve truth, consequence, and learnability.

---

## Authority

Simulation laws are constrained by:
- the Humanity Accord
- `design/accord_constraints.md`

No simulation rule may bypass dignity, transparency, or harm boundaries.

---

## Determinism

Given:
- identical initial state
- identical inputs
- identical time progression

The simulation must produce identical outcomes.

Non-determinism is permitted only where:
- explicitly modeled
- bounded
- inspectable

---

## State-Based Causality

All outcomes must be traceable to:
- prior state
- applied system rules
- elapsed time

No effect may occur without a cause.

Hidden state is forbidden.

---

## Time Progression

Time advances in discrete, ordered steps.

Processes:
- consume time
- cannot be skipped
- cannot be compressed to zero

Skill reduces waste and error, not time itself.

---

## System Execution Order

Each simulation step must follow a consistent order:

1. Input ingestion
2. System updates
3. Conflict resolution
4. Validation
5. Event generation
6. Logging

Order must be explicit and documented.

---

## Conservation Enforcement

Simulation must enforce:
- conservation of matter
- conservation of energy
- conservation of nutrients
- conservation of labor time

Violations are fatal errors.

---

## Failure Modeling

Failure is a valid outcome.

Simulation must:
- allow failure
- surface causes
- preserve recoverability where possible

Failure without explanation is invalid.

---

## Event Generation

Events record meaningful transitions.

Events must be:
- attributable
- timestamped
- linked to causal chains

Events are records, not drivers.

---

## Observability

Humans must be able to inspect:
- current state
- prior state
- causal path

Simulation that cannot explain itself violates transparency constraints.

---

## Boundaries

Simulation laws do not define:
- ethics
- values
- meaning

They enforce consequence only.

---

## Closing Statement

Simulation law exists to make reality legible.

When cause, time, and consequence remain visible, learning remains possible.
