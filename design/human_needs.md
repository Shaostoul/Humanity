## Human Needs Framework

This document defines a practical list of human needs so that we can talk concretely about what it means for people to live free from poverty in self-sustaining communities, habitats, and towns.

- **This is not a philosophical ranking of needs** – it is a practical checklist.
- **Every habitat or town should be assessable against this list** – “which needs are met, how, for whom, and for how long if cut off from outside support?”
- **Every major project or institution should be justifiable** in terms of one or more of these needs.

Where possible we describe:
- **What the need is**
- **What failure looks like in the real world**
- **What a self-sustaining town must provide**
- **How policies, designs, or behaviors might address it**

## 1. Survival & Health

These are the immediate requirements to keep bodies alive and functional.

- **Air & Breathable Atmosphere**
  - Humans need clean, breathable air within safe pressure and temperature ranges.
  - Failure: hypoxia, poisoning, suffocation, long-term respiratory illness.
  - Self-sustaining town: atmosphere generation/maintenance, filtration, pressure control, fire safety, leak management.
  - Applications: life support systems, airlocks, leak detection, fire/smoke management, air quality monitoring, maintenance and redundancy.
  - Indicative data (for Earth-like conditions):
    - Composition: ~21% oxygen by volume; safe long-term range roughly 19.5–23.5% O₂ at 90–110 kPa total pressure.
    - CO₂: comfort target \< 1,000 ppm indoors; occupational upper limit ~5,000 ppm for 8-hour exposure; acute symptoms above ~10,000–15,000 ppm.
    - Temperature: typical indoor comfort 18–26 °C; hypothermia risk \< 10 °C for lightly clothed people; heat stress risk \> 30 °C at high humidity.
    - Humidity: comfort and health range about 30–60% relative humidity indoors.
    - Space habitats: pure-oxygen or high-oxygen atmospheres should keep oxygen partial pressure in roughly the same range as Earth normal (≈20–35 kPa, e.g., 100% O₂ at ~0.3–0.5 atm), with very strict fire-safety design and material choices.

- **Water**
  - Reliable access to safe, potable water, plus water for hygiene, food production, and basic industry.
  - Failure: dehydration, disease, lost work time, dependency on vulnerable supply chains.
  - Self-sustaining town: capture (rain, ice, imports), storage, purification, distribution, recycling.
  - Applications: wells, condensers, treatment plants, plumbing networks, contamination monitoring, seasonal or environmental planning.
  - Indicative data (per person per day, temperate climate):
    - Drinking and food preparation: ~2–3 L/day minimum for adults at rest; 3–6 L/day in hot climates or heavy work.
    - Basic hygiene and domestic use: humanitarian standards often target 20–50 L/day; modern high-comfort use can exceed 100 L/day.
    - Emergency survival: 7–15 L/day total (drinking + minimal hygiene) used as a short-term lower bound in disaster relief.

- **Food & Nutrition**
  - Enough calories and micronutrients for everyone, every day.
  - Failure: hunger, malnutrition, long-term health damage, social instability.
  - Self-sustaining town: diversified food sources, storage buffers, local production, resilient supply chains.
  - Applications: agriculture systems, hydroponics, livestock, processing, spoilage management, trade, dietary variety and preference.
  - Indicative data (average adult, mixed activity):
    - Energy: ~1,800–2,000 kcal/day for smaller or less active adults; ~2,200–2,700 kcal/day for average adults; \>3,000 kcal/day for heavy manual labor.
    - Protein: ≈0.8 g/kg body weight/day as a baseline (e.g., ~50–70 g/day for most adults), higher in pregnancy, illness, or intense labor.
    - Fats and carbs: wide acceptable ranges; many public health guidelines aim for ~20–35% of calories from fats, bulk from complex carbohydrates.
    - Micronutrients: daily requirements for iron, iodine, vitamin A, B-vitamins, etc., are small in weight but critical; deficiencies can appear even when calories are sufficient.
    - Food security buffer: local or stored food equal to at least 2–6 months of normal consumption improves resilience to shocks.

- **Sleep & Rest**
  - Humans need sleep, downtime, and safe places to rest.
  - Failure: accidents, poor decisions, mental health collapse, reduced productivity.
  - Self-sustaining town: quiet spaces, shift design, cultural norms that allow rest, safe bedrooms.
  - Applications: schedules, shift design, bedroom quality, noise and lighting control, social expectations.
  - Indicative data:
    - Adults (18–64): typically 7–9 hours of sleep per 24 h for long-term health; older adults often 7–8 hours.
    - Teenagers: about 8–10 hours; school-age children often need 9–11 hours.
    - Noise: chronic night-time noise above ~40–45 dB(A) at pillow level is associated with measurable sleep disturbance.

- **Temperature & Shelter**
  - Protection from heat, cold, radiation, and weather.
  - Failure: hypothermia, heat stroke, structural damage, uninhabitable spaces.
  - Self-sustaining town: insulated housing, climate control, clothing, shaded areas, safe communal buildings.
  - Applications: climate-aware architecture, building insulation, heating/cooling design, clothing systems, storm preparedness.
  - Indicative data:
    - Indoor temperature: many health agencies recommend at least 18 °C for healthy adults, 20–22 °C for infants, elderly, or ill people.
    - Overcrowding: more than ~2–3 persons per bedroom or \< 5–10 m² usable floor area per person is often used as a rough overcrowding threshold.
    - Envelope performance: good insulation and airtightness can cut space-heating and cooling energy needs by 50–80% compared to uninsulated buildings in cold/temperate climates.

- **Healthcare & Body Integrity**
  - Access to basic medical care, prevention, and emergency response.
  - Failure: untreated injuries and disease, preventable death, fear of risk.
  - Self-sustaining town: clinics, trained personnel, medicines, sanitation, disease monitoring, vaccination.
  - Applications: medical infrastructure, medicine production, quarantine policies, triage protocols, public health systems.
  - Indicative data (service capacity benchmarks):
    - Health workers: the World Health Organization has used thresholds around 44–50 essential health workers (doctors, nurses, midwives combined) per 10,000 people for basic coverage.
    - Facility access: primary care within ~30–60 minutes travel time for most residents; emergency care reachable in significantly less where possible.
    - Vaccination and prevention coverage: many population-level disease controls assume \>80–95% coverage for key vaccines, sanitation, or vector control measures.

- **Sanitation & Waste Handling**
  - Safe disposal and recycling of human waste and other refuse.
  - Failure: disease spread, environmental contamination, loss of dignity, social conflict.
  - Self-sustaining town: toilets, sewage treatment, solid waste processing, recycling systems.
  - Applications: waste flow mapping, pollution control, recycling industries, resource recovery, overload safeguards.
  - Indicative data:
    - Toilets: in emergency standards, one hygienic toilet per ≤20 people is common; long-term, many societies target one per household or better.
    - Human waste: a typical adult produces roughly 1–2 L/day of urine and ~0.1–0.3 kg/day of feces (wet mass), requiring safe containment and treatment.
    - Solid waste: municipal solid waste generation often ranges from ~0.5–1.5 kg/person/day depending on income level and consumption patterns.

## 2. Safety, Stability & Predictability

Survival alone is not enough; people need stability and a sense that tomorrow is not constantly in doubt.

- **Physical & Structural Safety**
  - Protection from accidents, structural failures, and everyday hazards.
  - Failure: collapses, fires, explosions, unsafe workspaces, constant fear.
  - Self-sustaining town: building codes, inspections, safety training, emergency drills.
  - Applications: structural integrity checks, load limits, inspections, penalties for unsafe design, safety upgrades.
  - Indicative data:
    - Fire safety: common codes target full building evacuation within a few minutes (e.g., 2–5 minutes) via clearly marked, unobstructed exits and protected stairwells.
    - Structural loads: building codes specify design loads (wind, snow, occupancy) with safety factors, often targeting failure probabilities of less than 1 in 10,000–100,000 building-years for normal conditions.

- **Security from Violence & Exploitation**
  - People need to be safe from assault, theft, abuse, and coercion.
  - Failure: crime, oppression, trauma, breakdown of cooperation.
  - Self-sustaining town: fair policing, community norms, protections for vulnerable groups, transparent justice systems.
  - Applications: crime monitoring, policing strategies, surveillance vs privacy debates, justice mechanisms, conflict resolution systems.

    - Crime: violent crime rates below a few cases per 100,000 people per year are considered very low by global standards; rates above several hundred indicate serious safety challenges.
    - Policing: many countries field on the order of 150–400 police officers per 100,000 inhabitants, though effectiveness depends heavily on trust and accountability rather than raw numbers.

- **Economic & Material Stability**
  - People need predictable access to basic goods and a way to survive shocks.
  - Failure: sudden poverty, debt traps, resource hoarding, boom-bust cycles.
  - Self-sustaining town: buffers (storage, savings), diversified economy, stable institutions, safety nets.
  - Applications: inventories, stockpiles, insurance-like systems, unemployment support, welfare, guaranteed basic services.
  - Indicative data:
    - Household resilience: many personal finance guidelines suggest buffers of 3–12 months of essential expenses per household.
    - Community reserves: food, fuel, and critical spare parts stored locally for at least 2–6 months of normal consumption greatly increase resilience to trade or supply disruptions.

- **Redundancy & Resilience**
  - Critical systems must survive failures, disasters, and change.
  - Failure: single points of failure that collapse everything (one pump, one leader, one crop).
  - Self-sustaining town: redundancy in power, food, water, governance; emergency plans; modular systems.
  - Applications: resilience assessments, backup generators, diversification incentives, disaster planning, graceful degradation instead of catastrophic failure.
  - Indicative data:
    - N‑1 redundancy: many infrastructure systems are designed so that the failure of any single major component (one generator, one pipeline, one transformer) does not cause total service collapse.
    - Disaster planning: realistic emergency scenarios (multi-day power loss, weeks of supply disruption) should be survivable without mass harm.

- **Predictability & Trustworthy Rules**
  - People need rules they can understand and trust, not arbitrary power.
  - Failure: corruption, cynicism, learned helplessness, underinvestment in the future.
  - Self-sustaining town: consistent policies, transparent decision-making, enforceable contracts, social trust.
  - Applications: transparency mechanisms, anti-corruption safeguards, policy history tracking, reputation and trust-building practices.
  - Indicative data:
    - Transparency: public access to budgets, major contracts, and policy rationales; regular (e.g., annual) independent audits of key institutions.

## 3. Autonomy, Time & Agency

Even in poverty-free scenarios, humans need control over their own lives.

- **Control over One’s Time**
  - People need time that is not completely consumed by survival tasks or obligations.
  - Failure: burnout, lack of learning, no community life, no creativity.
  - Self-sustaining town: efficient infrastructure, reasonable work hours, tools that reduce drudgery.
  - Applications: time budgets, automation, labor-saving devices, trade-offs between comfort, productivity, and free time.
  - Indicative data:
    - Work time: many labor regulations recognize ~35–48 working hours per week as a typical full-time range; sustained work beyond this raises health and accident risks.
    - Commuting: daily commutes above ~60–90 minutes round-trip are widely associated with lower well-being.

- **Freedom of Choice & Movement**
  - Ability to choose work, relationships, and personal projects without constant coercion.
  - Failure: forced labor, locked-in roles, “golden cages” where survival depends on submission.
  - Self-sustaining town: diverse opportunities, multiple pathways to survival, ability to exit harmful situations.
  - Applications: job and role design, migration pathways, exit options, negotiation of contracts, norms of consent in social structures.
  - Indicative data:
    - Options: multiple viable employment and housing options within reasonable travel distance (not just a single employer or landlord controlling essentials).

- **Personal Space & Privacy**
  - Everyone needs some degree of privacy and control over their immediate environment.
  - Failure: constant stress, conflict, inability to recuperate or think clearly.
  - Self-sustaining town: room design, noise control, configurable living spaces, norms about boundaries.
  - Applications: overcrowding metrics, room quality, privacy vs surveillance trade-offs, mental health considerations.
  - Indicative data:
    - Personal space: beyond basic shelter, many housing standards use thresholds of ~10–20 m² private indoor space per adult as a comfortable minimum, with at least some fully private room or alcove.

## 4. Social Connection, Care & Belonging

Humans are social; isolation and neglect are harmful even when material needs are met.

- **Supportive Relationships**
  - People need others who care about them, practically and emotionally.
  - Failure: loneliness, abandonment, inability to recover from setbacks.
  - Self-sustaining town: families, friend groups, mutual aid networks, caregiving roles, elder and child care.
  - Applications: relationship networks, care tasks, social favors, support in crises, informal safety nets.
  - Indicative data:
    - Social contact: studies often associate higher well-being with at least several hours per week of meaningful, face-to-face interaction beyond transactional encounters.

- **Belonging & Inclusion**
  - Feeling recognized as a legitimate member of the community.
  - Failure: discrimination, exclusion, parallel “underclass” groups, hidden poverty.
  - Self-sustaining town: inclusive norms, shared rituals, accessible spaces, language and cultural respect.
  - Applications: festivals and shared events, inclusive design choices, practices that either reinforce or heal divisions.
  - Indicative data:
    - Participation: regular community-wide gatherings (monthly or seasonal) and smaller group meetings (weekly or monthly) are common rhythms in cohesive communities.

- **Conflict Resolution & Repair**
  - Conflicts are inevitable; communities need ways to resolve and repair harm.
  - Failure: feuds, cycles of revenge, silent resentment, fragmentation.
  - Self-sustaining town: mediation, restorative justice, councils, norms for apology and forgiveness.
  - Applications: conflict resolution processes, mediation practices, long-term reconciliations, legitimacy of institutions.

## 5. Meaning, Identity & Growth

Once survival and safety are reasonably secure, people still need reasons to care about tomorrow.

- **Purpose & Direction**
  - A sense that one’s life and work matter, individually and collectively.
  - Failure: apathy, nihilism, addiction, withdrawal from community.
  - Self-sustaining town: meaningful roles, shared long-term projects, narratives about why the town exists.
  - Applications: missions and projects that are not purely material, long-term goals, shared stories, legacy-building.

- **Learning & Skill Development**
  - Humans need to learn, improve, and gain mastery over time.
  - Failure: stagnation, boredom, inability to adapt to change, dependency on a few experts.
  - Self-sustaining town: education, apprenticeships, libraries, labs, experimentation spaces.
  - Applications: education systems, apprenticeships, libraries, labs, experimentation spaces, intergenerational knowledge transfer.
  - Indicative data:
    - School-age education: many systems target ≥10–12 years of basic education, with class sizes commonly aimed around 15–30 students per teacher in primary schools.
    - Lifelong learning: regular access to courses, workshops, or mentorship (e.g., at least a few structured learning opportunities per year per adult) helps maintain adaptability.

- **Creativity, Play & Expression**
  - Play, art, humor, and experimentation are not optional luxuries; they reinforce resilience and connection.
  - Failure: cultural decay, rigid conformity, lost innovation, mental health decline.
  - Self-sustaining town: art spaces, music, games, festivals, tools for making things for their own sake.
  - Applications: art spaces, music, games, festivals, hobbies, visual customization, emergent shared rituals.
  - Indicative data:
    - Time allocation: even in demanding societies, dedicating several hours per week per person to leisure, play, or creative activity is associated with better mental health and resilience.

- **Identity, Dignity & Recognition**
  - People need to be treated as persons, not interchangeable resources.
  - Failure: humiliation, internalized shame, disengagement, resistance.
  - Self-sustaining town: fair rewards, voice in decisions, visible acknowledgment of contributions.
  - Applications: titles, ceremonies, memorials, visible records of contributions, dignity-preserving aid systems.

## 6. Tools, Infrastructure & Competence

Even with the right intentions, poverty persists when communities lack the tools to shape their world.

- **Access to Tools & Infrastructure**
  - Physical and digital tools that extend human capabilities.
  - Failure: dependence on external powers, inability to repair or improve local conditions.
  - Self-sustaining town: workshops, laboratories, networks, computing, logistics networks, shared tools.
  - Applications: workshops, laboratories, networks, computing, logistics networks, shared tools, removal of bottlenecks that block willing workers.

- **Local Knowledge & Know-How**
  - Practical understanding of how to operate and repair the systems the town depends on.
  - Failure: “black box” systems that collapse when a few experts vanish, or imports stop.
  - Self-sustaining town: documentation, training, cross-training, redundancy of skills.
  - Applications: documentation, training, cross-training, mentorship, redundancy of critical skills.
  - Indicative data:
    - Skill redundancy: for every critical system (power, water, food, health, communications), at least 2–3 competent operators/maintainers per shift or per 1,000 people reduces vulnerability to single-person loss.

- **Energy & Material Flows**
  - Reliable energy and access to basic materials.
  - Failure: stalled production, cold homes, “poverty of possibility.”
  - Self-sustaining town: diverse energy sources, material recycling, repair culture.
  - Applications: power grids, fuel supplies, renewable vs nonrenewable trade-offs, circular economy practices.
  - Indicative data:
    - Electricity: studies of “decent living” often find that around 1,000–2,500 kWh of electricity use per person per year (with efficient technology) can support comfortable modern living, far below current rich-country averages.
    - Total energy: including heat and fuels, per-capita final energy demand for a dignified life is often estimated on the order of 20–40 GJ/year (≈5,500–11,000 kWh) if infrastructure is efficient.

## 7. Governance, Fairness & Voice

How decisions are made often determines whether resources actually reach people.

- **Participation & Voice**
  - People need some real influence over decisions that affect them.
  - Failure: alienation, uprisings, passive resistance, fragile legitimacy.
  - Self-sustaining town: councils, assemblies, voting, sortition, or other mechanisms with clear access paths.
  - Applications: councils, assemblies, voting, sortition, and other mechanisms that provide real access to decision-making.
  - Indicative data:
    - Frequency: many functioning democracies and cooperatives hold major elections or assemblies every 1–4 years, with more frequent (e.g., monthly or quarterly) meetings for detailed decisions.

- **Fairness & Justice**
  - Rules and outcomes must be perceived as fair, not rigged.
  - Failure: corruption, capture by elites, parallel informal power structures.
  - Self-sustaining town: transparent processes, checks and balances, appeal mechanisms.
  - Applications: anti-corruption measures, whistleblowing protections, audits, and public feedback based on perceived fairness.

- **Coordination & Collective Action**
  - Communities must handle problems no individual can solve alone.
  - Failure: under-provision of public goods, tragedy-of-the-commons, endless meetings with no action.
  - Self-sustaining town: institutions for shared projects (infrastructure, culture, defense, care).
  - Applications: public works projects, funding methods (taxes, contributions), collective risk management.

  - Applications: public education programs, literacy and numeracy initiatives, systems thinking and civic education.
  - Indicative data:
    - Literacy: basic literacy rates above ~95% and numeracy sufficient for everyday decisions are common targets in high-functioning societies.

---

## 9. Culture, Story & Continuity

Ending poverty is not just about raising numbers; it is about communities that want to go on existing.

- **Shared Stories & Identity**
  - Narratives about who “we” are and why we exist.
  - Failure: fragmentation, aimlessness, easy capture by harmful ideologies.
  - Self-sustaining town: agreed origin stories, future visions, remembered struggles and victories.
  - Applications: town histories, monuments, story events, community-authored traditions.

- **Rituals, Holidays & Rhythms**
  - Recurring events that mark time and bind people together.
  - Failure: endless, undifferentiated grind; no sense of progress or renewal.
  - Self-sustaining town: festivals, rest days, milestones, rites of passage.
  - Applications: calendar events, mood and morale practices, synchronization of activities, long-term cultural evolution.
  - Indicative data:
    - Rhythms: weekly rest days, annual festivals, and life-stage rituals (birth, coming-of-age, partnership, death) are nearly universal patterns across cultures.

- **Intergenerational Continuity**
  - Children, elders, and the transfer of knowledge and care between them.
  - Failure: lost expertise, neglected dependents, brittle cultures that reset every generation.
  - Self-sustaining town: education systems, elder roles, archives, mentorship.
  - Applications: multi-generational households, inheritance of assets and knowledge, long-running institutions.

## 10. Planetary & Ecological Foundations

Any poverty solution that destroys its ecological base is only postponing collapse.

- **Ecological Health**
  - Land, water, and ecosystems that can regenerate and support life.
  - Failure: resource exhaustion, pollution, climate damage, forced migration.
  - Self-sustaining town: sustainable harvest, regeneration, pollution control, planetary limits awareness.
  - Applications: ecosystem monitoring, renewable vs extractive choices, planning for consequences that unfold over decades.
  - Indicative data:
    - Land use: depending on diet and technology, estimates for sustainable cropland per person range from well under 0.1 ha (intensive greenhouse/hydroponic systems) to 0.2–0.5 ha or more for diversified low-input agriculture.

- **Material & Energy Boundaries**
  - Recognition that there are physical limits and trade-offs.
  - Failure: over-optimistic growth assumptions, debt built on impossible futures.
  - Self-sustaining town: explicit resource accounting, long-term planning, design for sufficiency, not just expansion.
  - Applications: hard caps on flows, planning for diminishing returns, accounting for environmental debt, long-term scenarios rather than short-term wins.
  - Indicative data:
    - Climate: global analyses often suggest long-term sustainable greenhouse gas emissions budgets on the order of \<=1–2 t CO₂‑equivalent per person per year to meet stringent climate targets, absent large-scale carbon removal.

## 11. Using This Framework

Anyone thinking about human flourishing and poverty—individuals, communities, planners, designers—can use this document as a **checklist**:

- **For each habitat, neighborhood, or town**, ask:
  - Which needs are currently met? How? By whom?
  - Which needs are fragile (one failure away from collapse)?
  - Which needs are outsourced to external powers (trade partners, central authorities)?
  - What happens if supply lines are cut, leadership changes, or climate shifts?

- **For each major policy, project, or system**, ask:
  - Which needs does this directly support?
  - Which needs might it accidentally undermine?
  - How does it change resilience, fairness, or autonomy?

This framework should evolve over time. As we discover better ways to describe human flourishing and poverty, we will revise and expand this document so discussions remain grounded in real human needs rather than abstract numbers alone.
