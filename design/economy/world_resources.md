# World Resources — Mirroring Reality

## Philosophy
The game mirrors real-world resource production, consumption, and reserves. Every number in the game comes from real data. Players learn actual economics, chemistry, agriculture, and engineering by playing. Fear comes from ignorance — transparency about humanity's actual capabilities dissolves it.

## Data Sources (Free, No API Key Required)
- USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries (annual)
- World Bank API (api.worldbank.org)
- UN FAO (food/agriculture)
- Our World in Data (energy, emissions, population)
- World Steel Association
- World Gold Council
- BP Statistical Review of World Energy
- FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)

## Data Categories

### 1. Elements & Minerals
For each of the 118 elements, where applicable:
- Annual global production (tonnes/year)
- Known reserves (tonnes)
- Years of supply at current rate
- Top producing countries
- Primary uses
- Price per unit

### 2. Materials & Alloys
For each of the 44 materials:
- Annual global production
- Input requirements (what elements/materials needed)
- Energy cost to produce
- Primary applications
- Processing chain (ore → refined → alloy → product)

### 3. Energy
- Global production by source (coal, oil, gas, nuclear, solar, wind, hydro, geothermal)
- Annual output in TWh
- Growth rates
- Capacity factors
- Cost per MWh
- Conversion efficiencies

### 4. Agriculture & Food
- Global crop production by type (grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes)
- Livestock numbers and output
- Fisheries and aquaculture
- Food waste statistics
- Caloric production vs. population needs
- Water usage per crop type
- Land usage

### 5. Population & Labor
- Global population (current + projections)
- Labor force by sector
- Literacy rates
- Life expectancy
- Urbanization rate

### 6. Infrastructure
- Global housing stock
- Transportation networks (roads, rail, shipping, air)
- Communication networks (internet, mobile, satellite)
- Water treatment capacity
- Power grid capacity

## Game Integration

### Reality Tab — "World Dashboard"
Shows humanity's ACTUAL resource status:
- Live-ish data (updated yearly for most, quarterly for some)
- Visual breakdowns (pie charts, bar charts, maps)
- "Did you know?" callouts that highlight surprising facts
- Comparison tools: "Your daily water use vs. global average"

### Fantasy Tab — Fleet Economy
Player fleet mirrors real production chains:
- Mining ships → Refineries → Factories → Products
- Farm ships → Processing → Distribution
- Energy generation → Grid → Consumers
- Ratios match reality (X tonnes ore → Y tonnes steel)
- Player contribution scales: "Your fleet produced 0.0001% of global steel output"

### Processing Chains (Examples)

#### Iron → Steel
1. Iron ore mining (2.5 tonnes ore per 1 tonne steel)
2. Coke production (coal → coke, 0.6 tonnes per tonne steel)
3. Blast furnace (ore + coke + limestone → pig iron)
4. Basic oxygen furnace (pig iron → steel)
5. Rolling/forming (steel → products)
- Energy: ~20 GJ per tonne
- Real world: 1.9 billion tonnes/year

#### Lithium → Battery
1. Lithium mining (brine evaporation or hard rock)
2. Lithium carbonate/hydroxide processing
3. Cathode material synthesis (NMC, LFP, etc.)
4. Cell manufacturing (electrode coating, assembly)
5. Battery pack assembly
- Real world: ~130,000 tonnes lithium/year

#### Wheat → Bread
1. Farming (seed, water, fertilizer, sunlight)
2. Harvesting
3. Milling (grain → flour)
4. Baking (flour + water + yeast → bread)
- Real world: ~780 million tonnes wheat/year

### Data Update Strategy
- Static baseline data baked into the app (works offline)
- Optional API calls to World Bank/USGS for latest numbers
- Community can submit corrections/updates
- Version-tagged data sets (2024 data, 2025 data, etc.)

## Teaching Through Play
- Player mines iron ore → sees "Real world: Australia produces 900M tonnes/year"
- Player grows wheat → sees "Real world: 780M tonnes/year feeds 8 billion people"
- Player builds solar panel → sees "Real world: silicon → wafer → cell → panel, $0.20/watt"
- Every crafting recipe shows the real-world equivalent
- "Humanity Score" tracks total human capability

## Fear Reduction Through Transparency
Key facts the game highlights:
- Earth produces enough food for 10+ billion people (waste is the problem, not production)
- Most "scarce" resources have centuries of reserves
- Renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels in most markets
- Global poverty has dropped from 36% to 9% in 25 years
- Literacy is at 87% globally and rising
- Child mortality has dropped 60% since 1990

The game doesn't hide problems — it shows both the challenges AND humanity's capacity to solve them.
