# Human Needs

## Purpose

This document defines a practical framework for understanding what humans require to live with dignity, stability, and agency over time.

It exists to ground discussions about poverty, flourishing, and societal design in concrete human realities rather than abstract metrics alone.

This is not a hierarchy of moral worth.
It is not a prescription for uniform lifestyles.
It is a shared reference for evaluating whether people can realistically live well.

## Foundational Principle

Human needs arise from the nature of human bodies, minds, and social existence.

They do not disappear through ideology, policy, or optimism.
They can be met in many ways, but they cannot be ignored without consequence.

A society that fails to meet these needs will eventually produce suffering, instability, or collapse.

---

## Categories of Human Need

Human needs cluster into interdependent domains.  
Meeting one domain while neglecting others produces fragility.

---

## 1. Survival and Health

These needs sustain the human body.

Without them, all other concerns become irrelevant.

This domain includes:
- breathable air
- safe water
- sufficient nutrition
- rest and sleep
- protection from extreme environments
- basic healthcare
- sanitation and waste management

Failure in this domain produces immediate harm, fear, and loss of life.

Meeting survival needs is the minimum requirement for dignity, not its fulfillment.

---

## 2. Safety, Stability, and Predictability

Humans require more than moment-to-moment survival.

They need confidence that tomorrow will not be arbitrarily worse than today.

This domain includes:
- physical safety
- protection from violence and exploitation
- structural and environmental safety
- economic and material stability
- resilience against shocks and failures
- predictable and understandable rules

When safety is absent, cooperation collapses into short-term self-preservation.

---

## 3. Autonomy, Time, and Agency

A life consumed entirely by survival is not a free life.

Humans require space to choose, reflect, and act.

This domain includes:
- control over one’s time
- freedom of movement and association
- the ability to change roles or paths
- personal space and privacy
- meaningful consent rather than coercion

Deprivation of agency produces despair, resentment, and resistance—even when material needs are met.

---

## 4. Social Connection, Care, and Belonging

Humans are social beings.

Isolation is harmful even in materially abundant environments.

This domain includes:
- supportive relationships
- mutual care across life stages
- inclusion and recognition
- conflict resolution and repair
- trust and shared norms

Societies that neglect social connection experience fragmentation and alienation.

---

## 5. Meaning, Identity, and Growth

Humans need reasons to care about the future.

This domain includes:
- purpose and direction
- opportunities for learning and mastery
- creativity, play, and expression
- dignity and recognition
- contribution to something larger than oneself

When meaning is absent, people disengage even if survival is secure.

---

## 6. Tools, Infrastructure, and Competence

Intent alone does not meet needs.

Humans require the means to shape their environment.

This domain includes:
- access to tools and infrastructure
- energy and material flows
- local knowledge and repair capability
- skill redundancy and competence
- the ability to adapt systems over time

Dependence on opaque or external systems increases vulnerability.

---

## 7. Governance, Fairness, and Voice

How decisions are made strongly affects whether needs are met.

This domain includes:
- participation in decisions
- fairness and justice
- accountability of power
- coordination for shared challenges
- legitimacy of institutions

People will not sustain systems they perceive as unjust or unresponsive.

---

## 8. Information, Understanding, and Transparency

Humans must be able to see and understand the systems they depend on.

This domain includes:
- access to reliable information
- shared understanding of risks and resources
- education and literacy
- transparency in decision-making

Ignorance and opacity concentrate power and perpetuate poverty.

---

## 9. Culture, Story, and Continuity

Human societies persist through shared meaning across generations.

This domain includes:
- shared narratives and identity
- rituals and rhythms
- intergenerational care
- preservation of memory and knowledge

Cultures that fail to transmit meaning must constantly rebuild trust from scratch.

---

## 10. Ecological and Planetary Foundations

Human life depends on ecological systems that operate beyond individual control.

This domain includes:
- healthy land, water, and ecosystems
- sustainable material use
- respect for physical and ecological limits
- long-term stewardship

Any solution that destroys its ecological base only delays collapse.

---

## Using This Framework

This framework can be used as a diagnostic tool.

For any community, habitat, or society, ask:
- Which needs are met reliably?
- Which are fragile or unevenly met?
- Which depend on external systems or luck?
- What happens under stress, failure, or change?

For any major decision or policy, ask:
- Which needs does this support?
- Which might it undermine?
- Who benefits, and who bears the risk?

---

## Closing Statement

Ending poverty is not a matter of charity or optimization.

It is the disciplined work of ensuring that human needs are met in ways that preserve dignity, agency, and continuity.

Any society capable of doing this can endure.

Any society that cannot, will not.
