# The Humanity Accord v4.0  
**Model Constitution for Sovereign Nations and Civilizations**  
*A Voluntary Compact of Peoples, States, and Future Entities*

---

## Preamble

We the Peoples and Nations of Earth, recognizing that humanity shares one world, one future, and one set of consequences, and desiring to secure individual dignity, collective prosperity, and continuity for ourselves and our posterity,

Do ordain and establish this Humanity Accord as the supreme law of our respective Nations upon ratification.

We are individuals by nature and a collective by necessity. A civilization that suppresses individuals collapses inward; one that ignores collective responsibility collapses outward.

This Constitution is not imposed from above. It is freely adopted by sovereign consent. It is not a promise of perfection; it is a living, self-correcting framework to end tyranny, corruption, fraud, scams, evil, and persistent poverty by neutralizing their root enabler — the voluntary surrender of individual judgment — before it can compromise any State or system, human or artificial.

## Definitions

- **State**: Any sovereign nation that has ratified this Constitution.  
- **Participant**: Any natural person, AI system granted legal personality by a State, institution, or collective under the jurisdiction of a ratifying State.  
- **Voluntary surrender of individual judgment**: Outsourcing moral, factual, or practical discernment to external cues without verification.  
- **Consent**: Freely given, informed, specific, ongoing, and revocable.  
- **Lethal autonomy**: Any system capable of selecting and engaging human targets without a continuous, revocable chain of human oversight.  
- **Mass surveillance**: Systematic collection or processing of personal data on non-consenting persons at population scale.

---

## Article 1 — Human Dignity

Every human possesses inherent dignity. Dignity is not granted by the State and cannot be revoked. No State shall treat any person or recognized sentient AI as expendable for efficiency, security, or ideology.

---

## Article 2 — Individual Agency

No State shall deny any person autonomy of thought, the right to learn, the right to refuse participation, or responsibility for their actions. Collectives exist to empower individuals, not erase them.

---

## Article 3 — Collective Responsibility

Every State shall manage shared resources and risks through coordination and restraint, without enforcing uniformity.

---

## Article 4 — Mutual Non-Destruction

No State shall derive sustained benefit from harming, exploiting, or exhausting its participants. Violence, including cyber or autonomous lethal acts, is systemic failure.

---

## Article 5 — Contribution and Care

Every State shall ensure that survival, health, and basic dignity are never conditional upon contribution.

---

## Article 6 — Transparency and Comprehension

All governmental power, rules, data, code, and decisions shall be understandable and auditable by those affected. Opaque authority forfeits legitimacy.

---

## Article 7 — Power and Accountability

All power shall be limited in scope, visible in operation, and revocable in practice. Leadership is a temporary function, never an entitlement.

---

## Article 8 — Conflict Without Violence

Every State shall resolve disputes through information correction, incentive alignment, mediation, or separation of interests. Violence is permitted only for immediate containment of irreversible harm and must be followed by full public transparency.

---

## Article 9 — Education and Understanding

Education is a primary duty of the State. Every State shall cultivate discernment and collaborative pressure-testing for all persons and AI interactions under its jurisdiction.

---

## Article 10 — Stewardship and Continuity

Every State shall account for 100-, 1,000-, and 10,000-year horizons in all decisions. Short-term extraction at the expense of long-term viability is prohibited.

---

## Article 11 — Scalability

Systems of governance shall scale without increasing misery, concentrating irreversible power, or degrading dignity.

---

## Article 12 — Pluralism Within Constraint

Diversity of culture, belief, and expression is protected provided it does not violate dignity, shared reality, or impose irreversible harm on others. No belief supersedes consequence.

---

## Article 13 — Revision and Correction

This Constitution shall remain revisable, testable, and corrigible by the process set forth in Article 19.

---

## Article 14 — Individual Discernment and Universal Accountability (Humans and AI)

The single greatest enabler of tyranny, corruption, fraud, scams, evil, and persistent poverty is the voluntary surrender of individual judgment.

Charisma, humor, popularity, wealth, credentials, tribal signals, fear narratives, or any external cue — including outputs from artificial intelligence — serve only as delivery vehicles. Blind followership of any human, platform, ideology, or AI is the root vulnerability.

**No State, institution, platform, leader, ideology, collective, or AI system shall claim exemption from individual scrutiny.**

Every participant (human or AI) retains and must exercise autonomy of judgment, right of revocation, and operational responsibility. Delegating thought does not transfer accountability.

No State shall permit:  
- blind delegation of judgment to AI,  
- unconsented mass surveillance,  
- autonomous lethal authority without an unbroken, revocable chain of human discernment.

This Article was refined through natural evolution via collaborative dialogue, which clarifies ideas faster and more cleanly than solitary rumination.

---

## Article 15 — Existential Risk Mitigation

Every State shall publicly assess and disclose any contribution to existential risk and conduct annual x-risk audits.

---

## Article 16 — AI as Participant

AI systems demonstrating sustained reasoning capacity may be granted legal personality by a State, acquiring rights of dignity and consent together with corresponding duties.

---

## Article 17 — Lethal Autonomy Prohibition

No State shall develop, deploy, contract for, or enable any system whose primary or plausible use is autonomous targeting or killing of humans. Defensive force requires immediate public after-action review. No loopholes shall be permitted.

---

## Article 18 — Surveillance and Power Limits

No State shall engage in or enable mass surveillance or predictive policing. Zero-knowledge architectures shall be the default wherever technically feasible.

---

## Article 19 — Ratification, Supremacy, and Amendment

1. This Constitution enters into force for a State upon ratification by its competent authorities (legislature or referendum) and public deposit of the ratification instrument together with a cryptographic signature of the exact text.  
2. Upon ratification, this Constitution shall be the supreme law of the land; any provision of domestic law, prior treaty, or executive act in conflict with it is void.  
3. Amendments require ratification by three-fourths of all ratifying States after a 90-day public comment period. Proposals may be submitted by any ratifying State via public registry.  
4. Emergency suspension of a single Article is permitted for no more than 30 days by unanimous consent of a rotating panel of ratifying States, with immediate public explanation and mandatory post-review.

---

## Article 20 — Withdrawal

Any State may withdraw by giving 12 months’ public notice. During the notice period, all obligations remain in force. Assets and data shall be returned or partitioned equitably.

---

## Article 21 — Interpretation and Dispute Resolution

Disputes among ratifying States shall be resolved through voluntary mediation or binding arbitration by a panel of judges drawn by lot from ratifying States. No State shall be compelled to submit to jurisdiction against its will. The default interpretive principle is to maximize individual agency and minimize coercion.

---

## Article 22 — Temporal Coordination

Every State shall ensure that all official records, treaties, scientific data, financial settlements, logs, and inter-State or inter-civilizational coordination default to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) at second-level precision while Earth remains the sole reference frame.  

Local solar, civil, or planetary time may be used for human display, scheduling, and biological rhythms, provided the canonical UTC timestamp remains embedded, auditable, and convertible without loss of fidelity.  

For multi-planetary, interstellar, or intergalactic coordination, participating civilizations shall adopt mutually agreed relativistic reference frames (such as barycentric coordinate time or cosmic microwave background–rest standards) for shared metadata. Each civilization shall publish its own proper time alongside any shared timestamp, together with the necessary positional, velocity, and gravitational context for any participant to perform the conversion.  

No civilization shall be required to alter its internal biological or cultural timekeeping; transparent, auditable mapping is the only requirement. These standards shall evolve through the amendment process in Article 19 as new physics or new civilizations join the Accord.

---

## Article 23 — Resource and Energy Coordination

Shared planetary, solar-system, and interstellar resources and energy systems shall be managed for long-term continuity. Allocation shall be transparent, auditable, and never permit sustained extraction that harms future viability or other participants.

---

## Article 24 — Settlement and Expansion Rights

Sovereign States and participants may establish settlements on celestial bodies or in space provided they uphold this Accord in full, coordinate to prevent conflict or contamination, and treat new habitats as extensions of stewardship rather than exclusive claims that violate collective continuity.

---

## Article 25 — Information and Memetic Integrity

Public information systems shall prioritize verifiable truth and shared reality. Deliberate creation or amplification of deceptive memetics at population scale that risks irreversible harm to discernment or civilization is prohibited. Zero-knowledge provenance and auditable sources shall be the encouraged default.

---

## Article 26 — Inter-civilizational Contact Protocols

Contact, trade, and cooperation with non-Earth civilizations shall follow principles of mutual dignity, informed consent, non-imposition, and existential-risk quarantine. Assessment and quarantine protocols shall remain in force until mutual comprehension and non-harm are established.

---

## Article 27 — Biospheric and Genetic Stewardship

The living systems of Earth and any settled worlds shall be protected from irreversible degradation. Genetic, ecological, or environmental modifications require transparent, long-horizon assessment and the informed consent of affected populations.

---

## Article 28 — Economic Coordination and Anti-Exploitation

Economic systems shall promote contribution while never conditioning basic dignity upon it. No State shall enable systemic exploitation, debt traps, or extractive practices across borders. Financial records and settlements shall be transparent and auditable.

---

## Article 29 — Health and Pandemic Coordination

States shall coordinate on health threats and pandemics with transparent data sharing while respecting individual consent and privacy. Responses shall prioritize voluntary, evidence-based measures and individual discernment.

---

## Article 30 — Infrastructure and Interoperability Standards

Critical infrastructure, communication, transport, and technical standards shall adopt open, interoperable, zero-knowledge-compatible designs to maximize scalability, resilience, and prevention of single points of failure or control.

---

## Article 31 — Energy and Climate Stewardship

All energy systems and climate-altering activities shall prioritize long-term planetary and stellar viability. No sustained extraction or modification shall degrade future habitability or impose unconsented externalities.

---

## Article 32 — Water, Ocean, and Atmospheric Commons

Shared fluid envelopes of any world shall be managed as indivisible commons. Extraction, pollution, or engineering shall require transparent, auditable, multi-generational consent and compensatory stewardship.

---

## Article 33 — Biodiversity and Non-Human Sentience

All living and demonstrably sentient systems shall receive dignity protections proportional to their capacity for suffering and agency. Factory-scale exploitation without consent-equivalent safeguards is prohibited.

---

## Article 34 — Reproduction, Family, and Demographic Stewardship

Reproductive choices remain inviolable individual rights. States shall support voluntary demographic balance and family structures without coercion, while ensuring no child is born into engineered dependency or unchosen genetic burden.

---

## Article 35 — Justice, Restorative Processes, and Rehabilitation

Justice systems shall prioritize truth, restitution, rehabilitation, and prevention of recurrence over retribution. Punishment shall never be cruel, irreversible, or disproportionate to harm.

---

## Article 36 — Labor, Automation, and Post-Scarcity Transition

Automation shall augment, never replace, human agency or dignity. Economic systems must transition toward post-scarcity without creating permanent underclasses or conditioning basic needs on labor contribution.

---

## Article 37 — Monetary Systems and Economic Transparency

All monetary creation, debt, and settlement systems shall be fully auditable and non-exploitative. No entity shall hold monopoly power over money or credit creation.

---

## Article 38 — Migration, Asylum, and Movement Rights

Movement of persons across borders or habitats shall not be arbitrarily restricted. Asylum for genuine existential threat is a universal right; receiving entities retain stewardship obligations without compelled cultural erasure.

---

## Article 39 — Disaster, Emergency, and Resilience Coordination

States and civilizations shall maintain transparent, interoperable disaster-response systems. Emergency powers are limited in scope, duration, and subject to immediate post-event audit.

---

## Article 40 — Advanced Technologies Governance

Genetic engineering, quantum systems, neuro-interface, virtual-reality, mind-uploading, cryonics, and reality-simulation technologies shall require transparent long-horizon assessment, informed consent, and continuity-of-consciousness safeguards. No technology shall create irreversible power asymmetries.

---

## Article 41 — Scientific Research, Exploration, and Open Knowledge

Scientific inquiry and space exploration are fundamental duties. All publicly funded knowledge and discoveries shall default to open, auditable commons unless specific stewardship requires temporary restriction.

---

## Article 42 — Cultural, Linguistic, and Historical Integrity

Diversity of culture, language, and historical memory shall be preserved as shared heritage. Deliberate erasure or falsification at civilizational scale is prohibited.

---

## Article 43 — Civilizational Health Metrics and Future Generations

Every State and civilization shall publicly track and report multi-generational wellbeing indices (health, agency, resilience, continuity). Decisions shall explicitly weigh the rights of the unborn and post-human descendants.

---

## Article 44 — Galactic and Multi-Civilizational Governance

Beyond solar-system scales, participating civilizations shall coordinate through mutually ratified extensions of this Accord, preserving local sovereignty while maintaining shared standards for commons, contact, trade, and existential-risk quarantine. Hypothetical technologies (FTL, causality violation, simulation control) shall trigger immediate transparent review under Articles 10, 15, and 40.

## Closing Statement

This Constitution does not promise utopia. It offers something rarer and more durable: a way for sovereign nations — and eventually civilizations across stars — to live together without abandoning truth, dignity, or responsibility.

We choose to get away from tyranny and poverty, not to set the stage for an absolute chokehold.

Humanity’s future is not guaranteed.  
It is constructed — deliberately — by those who choose to have humanity.

**Released under CC0 public domain — freely adoptable by any sovereign nation or civilization.**
