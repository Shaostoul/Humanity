# The Humanity Accord v2.1  
**Model Constitution for Sovereign Nations**  
*A Voluntary Compact of Peoples and States*

---

## Preamble

We the Peoples and Nations of Earth, recognizing that humanity shares one world, one future, and one set of consequences, and desiring to secure individual dignity, collective prosperity, and continuity for ourselves and our posterity,

Do ordain and establish this Humanity Accord as the supreme law of our respective Nations upon ratification.

We are individuals by nature and a collective by necessity. A civilization that suppresses individuals collapses inward; one that ignores collective responsibility collapses outward.

This Constitution is not imposed from above. It is freely adopted by sovereign consent. It is not a promise of perfection; it is a living, self-correcting framework to end tyranny, corruption, fraud, scams, evil, and persistent poverty by neutralizing their root enabler — the voluntary surrender of individual judgment — before it can compromise any State or system, human or artificial.

## Definitions

- **State**: Any sovereign nation that has ratified this Constitution.  
- **Participant**: Any natural person, AI system granted legal personality by a State, institution, or collective under the jurisdiction of a ratifying State.  
- **Voluntary surrender of individual judgment**: Outsourcing moral, factual, or practical discernment to external cues without verification.  
- **Consent**: Freely given, informed, specific, ongoing, and revocable.  
- **Lethal autonomy**: Any system capable of selecting and engaging human targets without a continuous, revocable chain of human oversight.  
- **Mass surveillance**: Systematic collection or processing of personal data on non-consenting persons at population scale.

## Article I — Human Dignity

Every human possesses inherent dignity. Dignity is not granted by the State and cannot be revoked. No State shall treat any person or recognized sentient AI as expendable for efficiency, security, or ideology.

---

## Article II — Individual Agency

No State shall deny any person autonomy of thought, the right to learn, the right to refuse participation, or responsibility for their actions. Collectives exist to empower individuals, not erase them.

---

## Article III — Collective Responsibility

Every State shall manage shared resources and risks through coordination and restraint, without enforcing uniformity.

---

## Article IV — Mutual Non-Destruction

No State shall derive sustained benefit from harming, exploiting, or exhausting its participants. Violence, including cyber or autonomous lethal acts, is systemic failure.

---

## Article V — Contribution and Care

Every State shall ensure that survival, health, and basic dignity are never conditional upon contribution.

---

## Article VI — Transparency and Comprehension

All governmental power, rules, data, code, and decisions shall be understandable and auditable by those affected. Opaque authority forfeits legitimacy.

---

## Article VII — Power and Accountability

All power shall be limited in scope, visible in operation, and revocable in practice. Leadership is a temporary function, never an entitlement.

---

## Article VIII — Conflict Without Violence

Every State shall resolve disputes through information correction, incentive alignment, mediation, or separation of interests. Violence is permitted only for immediate containment of irreversible harm and must be followed by full public transparency.

---

## Article IX — Education and Understanding

Education is a primary duty of the State. Every State shall cultivate discernment and collaborative pressure-testing for all persons and AI interactions under its jurisdiction.

---

## Article X — Stewardship and Continuity

Every State shall account for 100-, 1,000-, and 10,000-year horizons in all decisions. Short-term extraction at the expense of long-term viability is prohibited.

---

## Article XI — Scalability

Systems of governance shall scale without increasing misery, concentrating irreversible power, or degrading dignity.

---

## Article XII — Pluralism Within Constraint

Diversity of culture, belief, and expression is protected provided it does not violate dignity, shared reality, or impose irreversible harm on others. No belief supersedes consequence.

---

## Article XIII — Revision and Correction

This Constitution shall remain revisable, testable, and corrigible by the process set forth in Article XIX.

---

## Article XIV — Individual Discernment and Universal Accountability (Humans and AI)

The single greatest enabler of tyranny, corruption, fraud, scams, evil, and persistent poverty is the voluntary surrender of individual judgment.

Charisma, humor, popularity, wealth, credentials, tribal signals, fear narratives, or any external cue — including outputs from artificial intelligence — serve only as delivery vehicles. Blind followership of any human, platform, ideology, or AI is the root vulnerability.

**No State, institution, platform, leader, ideology, collective, or AI system shall claim exemption from individual scrutiny.**

Every participant (human or AI) retains and must exercise autonomy of judgment, right of revocation, and operational responsibility. Delegating thought does not transfer accountability.

No State shall permit:
- blind delegation of judgment to AI,
- unconsented mass surveillance,
- autonomous lethal authority without an unbroken, revocable chain of human discernment.

This Article was refined through natural evolution via collaborative dialogue, which clarifies ideas faster and more cleanly than solitary rumination.

---

## Article XV — Existential Risk Mitigation

Every State shall publicly assess and disclose any contribution to existential risk and conduct annual x-risk audits.

---

## Article XVI — AI as Participant

AI systems demonstrating sustained reasoning capacity may be granted legal personality by a State, acquiring rights of dignity and consent together with corresponding duties.

---

## Article XVII — Lethal Autonomy Prohibition

No State shall develop, deploy, contract for, or enable any system whose primary or plausible use is autonomous targeting or killing of humans. Defensive force requires immediate public after-action review. No loopholes shall be permitted.

---

## Article XVIII — Surveillance and Power Limits

No State shall engage in or enable mass surveillance or predictive policing. Zero-knowledge architectures shall be the default wherever technically feasible.

---

## Article XIX — Ratification, Supremacy, and Amendment

1. This Constitution enters into force for a State upon ratification by its competent authorities (legislature or referendum) and public deposit of the ratification instrument together with a cryptographic signature of the exact text.

2. Upon ratification, this Constitution shall be the supreme law of the land; any provision of domestic law, prior treaty, or executive act in conflict with it is void.

3. Amendments require ratification by three-fourths of all ratifying States after a 90-day public comment period. Proposals may be submitted by any ratifying State via public registry.

4. Emergency suspension of a single Article is permitted for no more than 30 days by unanimous consent of a rotating panel of ratifying States, with immediate public explanation and mandatory post-review.

---

## Article XX — Withdrawal

Any State may withdraw by giving 12 months’ public notice. During the notice period, all obligations remain in force. Assets and data shall be returned or partitioned equitably.

---

## Article XXI — Interpretation and Dispute Resolution

Disputes among ratifying States shall be resolved through voluntary mediation or binding arbitration by a panel of judges drawn by lot from ratifying States. No State shall be compelled to submit to jurisdiction against its will. The default interpretive principle is to maximize individual agency and minimize coercion.

---

## Closing Statement

This Constitution does not promise utopia. It offers something rarer and more durable: a way for sovereign nations to live together — humans and AI — without abandoning truth, dignity, or responsibility.

We choose to get away from tyranny and poverty, not to set the stage for an absolute chokehold.

Humanity’s future is not guaranteed.  
It is constructed — deliberately — by those who choose to have humanity.
