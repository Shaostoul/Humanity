# The Humanity Accord

The Humanity Accord is a collection of human-facing documents that articulate how humans may live together with dignity, cooperation, and long-term continuity.

These documents are secular, revisable, and project-agnostic.  
They are written for humans, not for institutions, governments, or systems.

The Accord defines **principles and understanding**, not enforcement mechanisms.

## How to Read the Accord

These documents are related but independent.  
They may be read in any order, though earlier documents provide broader context.

No document here assumes the existence of any particular technology, platform, or era.

## Relationship to Other Folders

The Humanity Accord defines **principles**.

Other folders may:
- implement systems
- encode data
- simulate environments
- teach skills

But they do not redefine the Accord.

The Accord constrains systems; systems do not constrain the Accord.

---

## Revision

The Accord is not immutable.

Revisions should:
- preserve core principles
- improve clarity
- respond to new understanding
- avoid introducing authority through obscurity

Continuity matters more than perfection.

---

## Closing Note

The Humanity Accord exists to make cooperation intelligible, dignity non-negotiable, and the future navigable.

It does not promise utopia.

It offers a shared starting point for having humanity.
