# The Humanity Accord

## Purpose

The Humanity Accord defines the foundational principles by which humans
may live together with dignity, safety, cooperation, and continuity.

It is a secular civilizational framework intended to:
- prevent domination and atrocity
- preserve human agency and consent
- enable peaceful scalability
- endure technological and cultural change

The Accord defines **what must never be violated**,
**what legitimacy requires**, and
**what happens when those conditions fail**.

---

## Scope

The Humanity Accord is:

- human-facing
- principle-driven
- non-ideological
- non-religious
- culturally non-exclusive
- revision-aware

It does **not** prescribe specific laws, punishments, or institutions.
It defines constraints that all such systems must respect.

---

## Structure and Authority

The Accord operates at the highest authority level.

All governance models, technical systems, social structures,
and implementations must conform to these documents.

No lower layer may override the Accord.

## Core Documents

### Humanity Accord (Foundational Charter)

- **`humanity_accord.md`**  
  The core charter defining dignity, agency, transparency, consent,
  non-domination, stewardship, education, and revisability.

This document establishes the moral and civilizational baseline.

---

### Rights and Responsibilities

- **`rights_and_responsibilities.md`**  
  A concise summary of fundamental human rights and shared responsibilities,
  balancing individual agency with collective trust.

Defines what humans are entitled to
and what they owe one another.

---

### Absolute Prohibitions

- **`absolute_prohibitions.md`**  
  Explicit, non-negotiable prohibitions against acts that destroy
  human dignity, agency, safety, or continuity.

Includes:
- sexual violence
- exploitation of children
- murder and human sacrifice
- abuse and torture
- slavery and trafficking
- theft and systemic misappropriation
- institutionalized harm

These prohibitions admit no cultural, religious, political,
or emergency-based exceptions.

---

### Failure of Legitimacy

- **`failure_of_legitimacy.md`**  
  Defines when individuals, institutions, or systems forfeit legitimacy
  by violating foundational constraints.

Establishes:
- when authority becomes invalid
- when compliance is no longer morally required
- when intervention and resistance become justified
- conditions for restoration of legitimacy

---

### Irreversible Actions

- **`irreversible_actions.md`**  
  Governs actions that permanently eliminate life, liberty, or agency,
  including extreme containment measures such as capital punishment.

Irreversible actions are treated as civilizational failure modes,
not instruments of justice or power.

---

### Ethical Principles

- **`ethical_principles.md`**  
  Articulates the ethical foundations underpinning the Accord,
  including restraint, accountability, dignity, and harm minimization.

These principles inform interpretation without overriding explicit constraints.

---

### Governance Models

- **`governance_models.md`**  
  Explores how authority may be structured, delegated, constrained,
  and revoked while remaining legitimate under the Accord.

Governance exists to coordinate, not dominate.

---

## Relationship to Other Layers

- **Design documents** translate Accord principles into enforceable system constraints.
- **Technical systems** must embody these constraints by construction.
- **Local laws and institutions** must remain compatible with Accord limits.

The Accord defines legitimacy.
Lower layers implement it.

---

## Revisability

No generation is infallible.

The Humanity Accord may be revised,
but revisions must:
- preserve human dignity
- strengthen consent and safety
- not weaken absolute prohibitions
- not legitimize domination or atrocity

Revisions that violate these conditions are invalid.

---

## Closing Statement

The Humanity Accord exists because power tends to concentrate,
harm tends to rationalize itself,
and silence tends to be exploited.

This framework draws clear lines.

Some acts are never acceptable.
Some authority is never legitimate.
Some failures require intervention.

Humanity endures
only if it chooses to have humanity.
