# Harm and Responsibility

## Purpose

This document defines how humanity understands harm, responsibility, and unacceptable conduct.

It exists to make boundaries explicit where principles alone are insufficient. Without clear limits, harm hides behind ambiguity, and responsibility dissolves into debate.

This document does not assign moral worth. It defines **consequence, obligation, and response**.

---

## Foundational Premise

Harm is not defined by intent alone.

Harm is defined by **impact on dignity, wellbeing, agency, trust, and long-term viability**.

Responsibility arises wherever action—or inaction—predictably affects others.

---

## Forms of Harm

Harm may take many forms. All are real.

### Physical Harm

Damage to the body, health, or biological function.

Includes:

* violence
* neglect of basic needs
* exposure to known danger without consent

---

### Psychological Harm

Damage to mental wellbeing, identity, or sense of safety.

Includes:

* intimidation
* humiliation
* manipulation
* sustained fear or uncertainty

---

### Social Harm

Damage to relationships, trust, or participation.

Includes:

* exclusion
* domination
* silencing
* erosion of agency or voice

---

### Economic and Material Harm

Damage to access, stability, or means of survival.

Includes:

* exploitation
* enforced dependency
* deprivation through unequal power

---

### Ecological Harm

Damage to the systems that support life.

Includes:

* irreversible environmental degradation
* extraction that undermines future viability

---

## Intent and Impact

Intent matters.
Impact matters more.

Ethical responsibility exists when harm is:

* foreseeable
* preventable
* ignored

Lack of malicious intent does not erase responsibility for predictable harm.

---

## Power and Responsibility

Responsibility scales with power.

Those with greater ability to influence outcomes bear greater obligation to:

* anticipate harm
* prevent abuse
* accept scrutiny
* enable correction

Neutrality in the presence of clear power imbalance favors harm.

---

## Categories of Failure

Not all failures are equal.

### Error

Unintentional harm arising from limited knowledge or skill.

Response:

* correction
* education
* system improvement

---

### Negligence

Harm caused by disregard for known risk.

Response:

* accountability
* repair
* restriction of authority if necessary

---

### Exploitation

Harm caused by intentional use of power imbalance for benefit.

Response:

* immediate intervention
* protection of those harmed
* removal of abusive power

---

## Non-Negotiable Prohibitions

The following behaviors are incompatible with human dignity and continuity:

* routine violence
* domination without consent or recourse
* exploitation of vulnerability
* deliberate deception causing harm
* systemic degradation of human dignity
* irreversible harm imposed without necessity or consent

No justification overrides these limits.

---

## Responsibility for Inaction

Failure to act can be harmful.

Responsibility exists when:

* harm is visible
* capacity to intervene exists
* inaction preserves personal comfort at others’ expense

Indifference is not neutral.

---

## Repair Obligations

When harm occurs, ethical responsibility includes:

* acknowledgment of harm
* acceptance of responsibility
* restitution where possible
* correction of conditions that enabled harm

Repair prioritizes restoration over punishment.

---

## Escalation and Protection

When harm persists:

* protection of the vulnerable takes precedence
* containment may be necessary
* escalation must be proportional

Containment exists to prevent further harm, not to satisfy retribution.

---

## Freedom and Boundaries

Boundaries do not restrict freedom.

They preserve it.

A society without limits empowers those most willing to cause harm.

Clear responsibility protects the freedom of those who act with care.

---

## Closing Statement

Harm is not always avoidable.

Refusal to acknowledge harm is.

Responsibility is the price of power, the cost of participation, and the foundation of trust.

A humanity willing to name harm and accept responsibility can correct its course.

A humanity that cannot will repeat its failures.
