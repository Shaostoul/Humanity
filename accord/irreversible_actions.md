# Irreversible Actions

## Purpose

This document defines constraints governing actions
that cannot be undone under the Humanity Framework.

Irreversibility demands the highest standard of restraint.

---

## Principle of Irreversibility

Actions that permanently eliminate:
- life
- liberty
- agency
- identity

require justification stronger than any reversible action.

Irreversibility increases responsibility, not authority.

---

## Capital Punishment

Capital punishment is not a penalty.
It is an extreme containment measure.

It may be considered only when all of the following are true:

1. The individual has committed acts defined as absolute prohibitions.
2. Guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt and plausible uncertainty.
3. The individual poses an ongoing, irreducible threat to others.
4. No form of containment, restraint, or rehabilitation can ensure safety.
5. The decision process is transparent, auditable, and collective.

Failure of any condition prohibits execution.

## Prohibited Uses of Irreversible Force

Irreversible force must never be used:
- for deterrence
- for punishment
- for revenge
- for political stability
- for ideological enforcement
- for administrative convenience

---

## Preference for Reversibility

Wherever possible:
- restraint is preferred to destruction
- isolation is preferred to elimination
- repair is preferred to punishment

Irreversible actions represent failure, not success.

---

## Relationship to Other Documents

- Absolute Prohibitions define intolerable acts.
- Safety and Responsibility define harm prevention.
- Governance Models define decision authority.
- Use of Force Constraints define proportionality.

---

## Closing Statement

A civilization is judged not by its power,
but by how rarely it finds execution necessary.

Restraint is the measure of legitimacy.
