# Rights and Responsibilities

## Purpose

This document summarizes the fundamental rights and responsibilities
that apply to all humans operating under the Humanity Framework.

Rights define what must not be violated.
Responsibilities define what must not be ignored.

Neither exists alone.

---

## Fundamental Human Rights

Every human retains the right to:

### 1. Agency and Self-Determination
- control over their own actions
- refusal of coercion or manipulation
- meaningful choice without hidden constraints

---

### 2. Privacy and Confidentiality
- privacy of personal communication
- confidentiality of beliefs, votes, and associations
- protection from surveillance without consent

Privacy claims must be truthful.
Misrepresentation of privacy protections is a violation of trust.

---

### 3. Truthful Representation
- accurate claims about system capabilities
- clear disclosure of limits and risks
- protection from deceptive assurances

Claiming security or privacy that does not exist
constitutes harm.

---

### 4. Secure Participation
- the ability to participate in collective decisions safely
- protection against vote tampering or suppression
- assurance that participation is counted accurately

Participation without integrity is coercion by other means.

---

### 5. Equal Standing
- one person, one voice
- no amplification, suppression, or substitution
- no privilege based on wealth, power, or access

---

### 6. Exit and Revocation
- the right to disengage
- the right to revoke consent
- the right to withdraw without penalty

Participation must remain voluntary.

---

## Fundamental Human Responsibilities

All humans share responsibility to:

### 1. Respect the Agency of Others
- do not coerce
- do not deceive
- do not manipulate consent

---

### 2. Preserve Collective Trust
- do not undermine shared systems
- do not introduce hidden harm
- do not exploit complexity for advantage

Trust, once broken, is difficult to repair.

---

### 3. Safeguard Shared Systems
- protect the integrity of collective processes
- report vulnerabilities rather than exploit them
- prioritize resilience over convenience

---

### 4. Accept Accountability
- acknowledge impact
- repair harm when possible
- correct systems that produce harm

Denial compounds damage.

## Rights and Responsibilities in Balance

Rights without responsibility decay into exploitation.
Responsibilities without rights become oppression.

A stable civilization requires both.

---

## Closing Statement

Human rights are not permissions.
Human responsibilities are not optional.

They are the minimum conditions
for living together without domination or fear.
