# Governance Models — Coordination Without Domination

This document defines how humans coordinate decision-making at scale
without sacrificing dignity, autonomy, or long-term stability.

Governance exists to solve coordination problems,
not to rule people.

---

## 1. First Principles of Governance

1. Governance exists to coordinate, not dominate.
2. All authority must be accountable, limited, and revocable.
3. Governance must scale without concentrating irreversible power.
4. Governance must preserve both individual agency and collective viability.
5. Safety and consent constrain all governance action.

---

## 2. Rejection of False Binaries

Human history is burdened by false choices:
- authoritarianism vs chaos
- individual freedom vs collective good
- centralization vs fragmentation

These are design failures.

Effective governance balances:
- autonomy and coordination
- freedom and responsibility
- decentralization and coherence

---

## 3. Scale-Aware Governance

No single governance model works at all scales.

### 3.1 Individual Scale

- autonomy is primary
- consent is explicit
- coercion is invalid

Individuals govern themselves by default.

---

### 3.2 Community Scale

- decisions affect shared resources
- participation is direct or delegated
- transparency is mandatory

Consensus is preferred.
Supermajority is acceptable.
Opacity is not.

---

### 3.3 Regional Scale

- delegation becomes necessary
- representation must be recallable
- scopes of authority must be explicit

Representatives are instruments, not rulers.

---

### 3.4 Civilizational Scale

- governance sets boundaries, not micromanagement
- local autonomy is preserved
- enforcement power is minimized

Civilizational governance exists to prevent harm,
not to enforce uniformity.

---

## 4. Authority Design

### 4.1 Authority Is Conditional

Authority exists only while it:
- fulfills its declared function
- respects consent boundaries
- remains transparent and accountable

Authority without conditions becomes tyranny.

---

### 4.2 Authority Must Be Legible

People must be able to understand:
- who holds power
- what that power can do
- how it can be revoked

Opaque power structures are illegitimate.

---

## 5. Decision-Making Standards

Decisions must be:
- evidence-based
- reversible where possible
- transparent in reasoning
- bounded in scope

Belief alone is insufficient justification.

---

## 6. Power Distribution

### 6.1 Decentralization by Default

Power should reside as close as possible
to those affected by it.

Centralization requires justification
and must remain temporary.

---

### 6.2 No Permanent Concentration

Safeguards must include:
- term limits
- recall mechanisms
- role rotation

Permanent authority is incompatible with human fallibility.

---

## 7. Conflict and Failure Handling

Governance failure must trigger:
- review
- correction
- restructuring

Not denial.
Not escalation.

---

## 8. Governance and Peace

Sustainable peace requires:
- predictable systems
- fair participation
- nonviolent dispute resolution

Violence indicates governance failure.

---

## Final Statement

Governance is not about ruling humans.

It is about helping humans
rule themselves together
across time, scale, and difference.
