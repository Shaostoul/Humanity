# Minimum Transparency Checklist

This checklist defines the minimum conditions a system must satisfy
before it can claim alignment with the Humanity Framework.

Failure to meet any item invalidates that claim.

---

## System Visibility

- [ ] Current system state is visible at all times
- [ ] Recent actions are visible without delay
- [ ] Pending actions are visible before execution

---

## Decision Transparency

- [ ] Decision paths are exposed
- [ ] Inputs and assumptions are visible
- [ ] Constraints and limits are declared
- [ ] Confidence and uncertainty are shown

---

## Control and Intervention

- [ ] Human override is always available
- [ ] Revocation of consent halts action immediately
- [ ] Fallback behavior is visible before use

---

## Records and Traceability

- [ ] Actions are logged automatically
- [ ] Logs are timestamped
- [ ] Logs link actions to rules and inputs
- [ ] Logs are accessible to affected parties

---

## Interface Integrity

- [ ] No hidden modes or silent defaults
- [ ] No deceptive or coercive presentation
- [ ] Safety controls are usable under stress

---

## Failure Handling

- [ ] Failure modes are documented
- [ ] Failure states are visible when they occur
- [ ] Degradation preserves human agency

---

## Final Validation
