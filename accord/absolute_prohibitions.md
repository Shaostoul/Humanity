This document defines actions that are categorically illegitimate
under the Humanity Framework.

## Principle of Absolute Prohibition

Certain actions destroy the conditions required
for human dignity, agency, safety, and continuity.

These actions:
- cannot be consented to
- cannot be justified by outcome
- cannot be relativized by culture
- cannot be excused by authority

They are prohibited without exception.

All forms of non-consensual sexual activity are prohibited, including:
- rape
- sexual assault
- sexual coercion

Absence of resistance does not constitute consent.

Children cannot consent.

The intentional killing of non-aggressors is prohibited, including:

and never as punishment or authority.

---

### 4. Abuse, Torture, and Cruelty

The following are prohibited:
- physical abuse
- psychological abuse
- torture
- degrading or dehumanizing treatment

Infliction of suffering for control, punishment, fear, or gratification

## Prohibited Acts Against Agency and Dignity

### 6. Coercion and Domination

- enforced dependency

Consent obtained through coercion is invalid.

---

### 7. Dehumanization

is prohibited.

Dehumanization precedes atrocity
and is itself an atrocity.

- systemic coercion

is invalid.

---

## Prohibited Institutional Acts

### 9. Institutionalized Harm

Institutions are prohibited from:
- enabling or concealing prohibited acts
- normalizing abuse through policy
- protecting perpetrators through opacity
- externalizing harm onto the powerless

Institutions bear responsibility
for harm they enable or fail to prevent.

---

## No Exceptions Clause

No appeal to:
- culture
- tradition
- religion
- ideology
- emergency
- economic necessity
- political stability

overrides these prohibitions.

---

## Relationship to Other Documents

- Ethical Principles define dignity and restraint.

## Closing Statement

Some acts end legitimacy.

They are not differences of opinion.
They are not cultural variations.
They are violations of humanity itself.

Humanity does not negotiate with atrocity.
