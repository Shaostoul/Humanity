# User Safety Overview

## Why This Exists

Complex systems affect people’s lives.

User safety exists to ensure that:
- individuals retain control over what affects them
- harm is minimized before it occurs
- power does not hide behind complexity

Safety is not about fear.
It is about trustworthiness.

## Core Safety Commitments

All systems interacting with humans must:
- be transparent by default
- respect consent at all times
- make uncertainty visible
- allow revocation and exit
- fail in ways that preserve agency

If a system cannot explain what it is doing,
it is unsafe.

## What Users Should Always Be Able to See

Users should always be able to understand:
- what the system is doing
- why it is doing it
- what data it is using
- what could go wrong
- how to stop or change it

No request should be required.

---

## Control and Choice

Users must be able to:
- opt in knowingly
- opt out immediately
- change their minds without penalty

Systems must not rely on:
- hidden defaults
- coercive design
- exhaustion or confusion

---

## Responsibility

When systems cause harm,
responsibility lies with those
who designed, deployed, or authorized them.

Users are never responsible
for harm caused by hidden behavior or unclear consent.

---

## Summary

Safety is not a promise.
It is a constraint.

Transparency is not optional.
Consent is not implied.
Control must remain human.

A system that respects these principles
is worthy of trust.
