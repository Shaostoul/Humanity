# Scope Boundaries

## Purpose

This document defines how humanity distinguishes between **reality**, **models**, **speculation**, and **fiction**.

Clear boundaries between these domains are not optional.  
They are required for education, cooperation, trust, and long-term survival.

When boundaries blur, misunderstanding spreads.  
When misunderstanding spreads, harm follows.

## Foundational Principle

Reality exists independently of belief, preference, or narrative.

Human understanding of reality is always incomplete, but it can improve through evidence, observation, and correction.

No story, system, or explanation is permitted to override physical consequence.

---

## The Four Domains of Understanding

Human knowledge and expression operate across four distinct domains.  
Each has value. Each has limits.

### 1. Observed Reality

Observed reality consists of phenomena that can be:

- directly measured
- independently verified
- repeatedly observed
- constrained by physical law

This includes:
- physics
- biology
- chemistry
- ecology
- engineering outcomes

Observed reality is the **anchor domain**.  
All other domains must defer to it.

---

### 2. Modeled Reality

Modeled reality consists of simplified representations of observed reality.

Models exist to:
- explain
- predict
- teach
- simulate

Models are **tools**, not truth.

They are always:
- incomplete
- approximate
- context-dependent

When models conflict with observation, the model must change—not reality.

---

### 3. Speculative Extension

Speculation explores what *might* be possible beyond current observation.

Speculation is valid when it:
- is clearly labeled
- respects known constraints
- remains falsifiable
- does not claim certainty

Speculation drives innovation and imagination, but it must never be confused with established fact.

---

### 4. Fictional Construction

Fictional constructs are intentionally unconstrained by reality.

They exist for:
- storytelling
- exploration of values
- imaginative experimentation
- cultural expression

Fiction is powerful and valuable—but it is **not evidence**.

Fiction must never be presented as reality or used to justify real-world decisions without explicit translation back into observed or modeled reality.

---

## Boundary Integrity

Crossing boundaries without acknowledgment is a failure of responsibility.

Examples of boundary violations include:
- presenting fiction as fact
- treating speculative ideas as proven
- ignoring physical constraints for convenience
- using models without disclosing assumptions
- allowing narratives to override consequence

Boundary integrity protects:
- learners from misinformation
- communities from manipulation
- systems from collapse

---

## Education and Boundary Awareness

A core function of education is teaching people to recognize which domain they are operating within.

Competence includes the ability to say:
- “This is known.”
- “This is modeled.”
- “This is speculative.”
- “This is fictional.”

Confusion between these statements is not harmless.

---

## Evolution of Understanding

Boundaries do not prevent progress.

They enable it.

As observation improves:
- speculation may become modeled reality
- models may be refined or discarded
- understanding may deepen

Boundaries are not walls.  
They are **labels** that preserve clarity while allowing growth.

---

## Closing Statement

Humanity advances by understanding what is real, what is uncertain, and what is imagined—and by refusing to confuse them.

Clarity is not limitation.

Clarity is freedom.
