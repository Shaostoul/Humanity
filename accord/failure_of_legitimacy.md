# Failure of Legitimacy

## Purpose

This document defines what occurs when individuals, institutions,
or systems violate the foundational constraints of the Humanity Framework.

Legitimacy is conditional.
It can be lost.

---

## Definition of Legitimacy

Legitimacy is the moral and civil authority
to act on behalf of others.

Legitimacy requires:
- consent
- transparency
- accountability
- adherence to absolute prohibitions

Power without legitimacy is domination.

---

## Conditions of Failure

Legitimacy is forfeited when an individual, institution, or system:

- commits an absolute prohibition
- enables or conceals prohibited acts
- violates consent in ways that cause harm
- exercises force outside defined constraints
- engages in systemic theft or coercion
- maintains power through fear, deception, or opacity

Intent is irrelevant.
Impact governs legitimacy.

---

## Immediate Consequences

Upon failure of legitimacy:

1. Authority is invalidated  
2. Compliance is no longer morally required  
3. Intervention to prevent further harm becomes justified  

No entity may claim obedience
while violating foundational constraints.

---

## Obligation to Protect

When legitimacy fails,
priority shifts to:
- protection of victims
- prevention of further harm
- containment of abusive power

Stability does not override safety.

---

## Responsibility and Accountability

Responsibility lies with:
- perpetrators
- enablers
- decision-makers
- institutions that allowed harm to persist

Delegation does not absolve responsibility.

---

## Restoration of Legitimacy

Legitimacy may be restored only through:
- cessation of harm
- acknowledgment of violation
- accountability for actions
- meaningful repair
- structural correction

Denial or cosmetic reform is insufficient.

---

## Resistance to Illegitimate Authority

Resistance to illegitimate authority is justified
when peaceful correction is unavailable
and harm is ongoing.

Resistance must remain:
- proportionate
- targeted
- oriented toward restoration of legitimacy

Domination may be resisted.
Domination must not be replicated.

---

## Relationship to Other Documents

- Absolute Prohibitions define red lines.
- Use of Force Constraints define limits of resistance.
- Governance Models define corrective mechanisms.
- Safety and Responsibility define harm thresholds.

---

## Closing Statement

Legitimacy is not permanent.
It must be maintained.

Power that violates humanity
voids its own authority.

When legitimacy fails,
humanity has the right—and responsibility—to act.
