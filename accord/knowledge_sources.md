# Knowledge Sources

## Purpose

This document defines how humans identify, evaluate, and revise knowledge.

No civilization can remain stable if it cannot distinguish between reliable understanding and error.  
Knowledge is not static. It must be continually tested, corrected, and contextualized.

This document establishes principles, not authorities.

---

## Foundational Principle

No source is infallible.

All knowledge is provisional, conditional, and subject to revision when confronted with better evidence or clearer reasoning.

Trust in knowledge arises from **method**, not origin.

---

## Categories of Knowledge Sources

Human knowledge emerges from multiple source types. Each has value and limitations.

### 1. Direct Observation

Direct observation includes:
- measurement
- experimentation
- repeated sensory evidence
- reproducible outcomes

This is the most reliable foundation of knowledge.

Observations gain strength when they are:
- independently verified
- repeatable
- transparent in method

---

### 2. Empirical Research

Empirical research builds on observation through structured inquiry.

Reliable research:
- documents methodology
- exposes assumptions
- allows replication
- reports uncertainty

Authority does not arise from credentials alone, but from openness to verification and correction.

---

### 3. Engineering and Practice

Practical application generates knowledge through use.

A method that:
- functions consistently
- produces predictable outcomes
- fails in understandable ways

contributes valid knowledge, even when theory is incomplete.

Practice reveals constraints theory may miss.

---

### 4. Historical Record

History provides insight into:
- human behavior
- systemic patterns
- long-term consequences

Historical knowledge is interpretive and must be treated carefully.

Records may be:
- incomplete
- biased
- context-dependent

Patterns matter more than narratives.

---

### 5. Cultural and Experiential Knowledge

Communities accumulate understanding through lived experience.

This includes:
- traditional practices
- generational memory
- localized adaptation

Such knowledge is valuable but must remain open to examination and integration with broader evidence.

Tradition explains what worked—not necessarily why.

---

### 6. Theoretical and Mathematical Models

Abstract reasoning allows humans to:
- explore possibilities
- test consistency
- extend understanding beyond direct observation

Models are tools, not truth.

Their validity depends on:
- assumptions
- boundary conditions
- empirical alignment

---

## Evaluation Criteria

A knowledge source gains reliability when it demonstrates:

- transparency of method
- openness to critique
- consistency with observed reality
- capacity for prediction or explanation
- willingness to be revised or discarded

Claims that resist examination weaken collective understanding.

---

## Revision and Correction

Correction is not failure.

It is the mechanism by which understanding improves.

Healthy knowledge systems:
- reward correction
- document change
- preserve past errors for learning
- resist permanent dogma

No idea is exempt from reevaluation.

---

## Misuse of Knowledge

Knowledge becomes dangerous when it is:
- presented without context
- detached from consequence
- treated as immutable truth
- weaponized for control or manipulation

Information without responsibility erodes trust.

---

## Education and Literacy

A core responsibility of education is teaching people how to:
- question sources
- recognize uncertainty
- differentiate evidence from assertion
- update beliefs responsibly

Knowledge literacy is a prerequisite for self-governance.

---

## Closing Statement

Humanity advances not by clinging to certainty, but by maintaining disciplined humility.

Knowledge is not what is believed.

Knowledge is what survives contact with reality.
