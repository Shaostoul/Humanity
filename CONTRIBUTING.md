# Contributing to Humanity

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

Humanity is designed to endure across generations.  
Changes must preserve coherence, authority, and intent.

## Authority model (mandatory)

This repository follows a strict authority stack:

1. `accord/` — civilizational principles
2. `design/` — technical constraints and system law
3. `data/` — structured instances
4. `engine/`, `tools/`, `website/`, `assets/` — implementations and presentations

Rules:
- Lower layers may not contradict or redefine higher layers.
- Presentation layers may not introduce new meaning.
- Tools and interfaces are non-authoritative.

## How to propose changes

- **Philosophical or ethical changes**  
  → Propose edits to files in `accord/`

- **System rules, constraints, schemas**  
  → Propose edits to files in `design/`

- **Examples, instances, content**  
  → Propose edits to files in `data/`

- **Presentation, UI, integrations**  
  → Propose edits to `website/`, `assets/`, or `tools/`

If a proposal spans multiple layers, it must be justified at the highest affected layer.

## What not to do

- Do not duplicate canonical documents into presentation folders
- Do not encode mechanics into assets
- Do not introduce ideology into tools or summaries
- Do not bypass the authority model for convenience

---

## Review philosophy

- Clarity beats cleverness
- Explicit beats implicit
- Stability beats speed
- Revision beats rigidity

This project values long-term integrity over short-term momentum.
