# HumanityOS — Gameplay Systems & Loops (holistic map)

> **Status:** design anchor for the gameplay arc (opened 2026-05-30 from the operator's
> vision brain-dump). This is the map of *what loops exist and how they connect*; each
> loop ships as its own increment. Most of the underlying systems already exist in code
> (see `tests/engine_wiring_lint.rs::DEFERRED_SYSTEMS` — ~40 systems implemented,
> mostly unregistered) — the work is **wiring them into loops + spawning content + the
> connective glue**, not writing them from scratch.

## Development posture: fully unlocked

For development we play **as if the player has unlocked everything 100%** — all recipes
available, materials on hand, every system active — so every loop is testable *as we
build it*, and we can balance space requirements, timings, and interactions across the
whole system at once. Progression / skill-gating / tech-unlock is a **presentation layer
added last** (it just hides/locks parts of an already-working system). A dev/creative
provisioning (stock materials + unlock recipes) is the first thing we build.

## The big picture: three layers + the connective tissue

```

You produce **to meet needs**; meeting needs (esp. nutrition) **buffs you**, which makes
producing/acquiring easier — the core compounding loop. Scarcity (finite asteroids),
decay/maintenance, and disasters apply pressure.

## 1. Character survival needs — *why you produce*

| Need | Model (proposed) | System (exists) |
|---|---|---|
| **Nutrition** | Baseline **Satiation** (hunger) must stay > 0 or health drains. Above baseline, a few axes (calories/energy, protein, vitamins) — **variety + surplus → buffs**, deficiency → debuffs. **Cooked** food = more satiation + better/longer buffs; **raw** = edible but less, some risky. | `food`, `farming` |
| **Hydration** | **Thirst** baseline; water from sources/processing. | `hydrology` (water bodies), `food` |
| **Health** | Injury/healing; death at 0. | `combat`, `medical` |
| **Oxygen** | Breathable air in enclosed/space; suffocation otherwise. | `atmosphere` |
| **Temperature** | Cold/heat stress; mitigated by shelter/clothing/HVAC. | `weather`, `hvac` |
| **Energy/rest** | Exertion drains; rest restores; affects work speed. | `psychology`, `aging` |
| **Sanitation** | Waste handling; neglect → disease pressure. | `waste`, `ecology` |

**Buffs from good nutrition (operator's idea):** move speed, reload/work speed, night
vision, stamina, carry weight, etc. — concrete, visible rewards for eating well. Harm
from poor nutrition: the inverse debuffs + health drain.

## 2. Production chain — *how you sustain + grow*

### Acquire (raw inputs)
- **Mining via space drone (operator's core loop):** player commissions a **drone** →
  it travels to an **asteroid** → mines requested ores (iron, nickel, platinum…) over
  **time** → returns home → **drops off raw material**. Asteroids hold **finite**
  resources; in MMO many players swarm one for the valuable ores then the scraps; when
  **fully consumed or abandoned the asteroid entity is deleted**. (Asteroid voxel system
  + ore veins already exist in `terrain/asteroid.rs`; the drone is a timed autonomous
  task + cargo return.)
- **Farm / garden:** plant → grow (driven by `game_time` + water + season) → harvest. A
  **concise base plant set covers complete nutrition forever**; players expand. (See §4.)
- **Forage / gather** (surface pickups) and **salvage / recycle** (break items back to
  materials) round out acquisition.

### Refine → Manufacture → Construct
- **Refine:** raw ore/material → refined material (e.g. iron ore → iron ingot → steel).
  Recipe chains already exist (`crafting`, `smelting`/`refining` categories).
- **Manufacture:** material → **components** (motors, gears, screws, rails…) → items /
  tools / machines. (`crafting`, `manufacturing`; components data exists.)
- **Construct:** items → structures / base / infrastructure. (`construction`/`placement`.)

## 3. Connective world systems

Drones & vehicles + **autonomous tasks** (the mining drone is the first); **logistics /
storage** (typed material-aware **containers — already built**, + inventory);
**power/electrical** (machines need power); **water/hydrology**; **time/seasons** (wired);
**weather**; **economy/trading** (player↔player, relay-mediated); **governance**.

## 4. Concise complete plant set (proposed starting point)

Goal: the smallest set of plants whose harvests **together** cover complete human
nutrition (carbs, protein, fats, key vitamins/minerals) — grounded in real survival
agronomy (fits the educational mission). Players expand from here.

| Plant | Covers | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Potato** | Carbohydrate/calorie staple, vitamin C, potassium | High calories/area, fast, stores well |
| **Soybean** (or beans/lentil) | Protein + fat | Complete-ish protein, nitrogen-fixing |
| **Kale/Spinach** (leafy green) | Vitamins A/K/folate, iron, calcium | Fast cycle, cut-and-come-again |
| **Tomato** | Vitamin C, antioxidants, flavor | Cookable; high yield |
| **Sunflower** (seed/oil) | Fats/oil, vitamin E | Oil pressing → cooking fat |
| **Carrot** | Vitamin A, fiber, root storage | Root crop, long storage |

(6 plants ≈ complete nutrition. Final list/balance is the operator's call — this is a
defensible default.)

## What exists vs what needs building

- **Exists (mostly unregistered, see the lint):** farming, asteroid+mining, crafting,
  food, medical, atmosphere, hydrology, weather, electrical, vehicles, construction,
  economy, logistics, AI/autonomy.
- **Needs building:** the **loops** that connect them, **content entities** (spawned
  crops/asteroids/drones), the **full-unlock dev provisioning**, the **GUI→ECS command
  bridge** (so UI buttons drive real ECS actions), and the new glue: the **drone task**,
  **nutrition effects/buffs**, and the **real crafting consume/produce**.

## Proposed build order

1. **✅ DONE (v0.329.0) — Full-unlock dev provisioning** — "Dev: stock all materials" stocks one stack of every recipe input (raws + intermediates); the GUI→ECS command bridge it needs (GuiState flag → main-loop DataStore Mutex channel → owning System drains in its tick) is reused everywhere. *(testing enabler)*
2. **✅ DONE (v0.329.0) — Real crafting loop** — Craft button → CraftingSystem consume inputs / produce outputs → inventory updates live. *(first end-to-end playable loop)*
3. **✅ DONE (v0.330.0) — Cooking + nutrition** — `Vitals` (satiation/hydration) + `StatusEffects` components; `FoodSystem` registered & extended: eat (Eat button → consume bridge) restores satiation/hydration from `food_system.ron` nutrition profiles, raw food rolls `raw_consumption_risk` → `food_poisoning`, a full meal → `well_fed`; hunger/thirst decay → `hungry`/`thirsty` conditions → starvation/dehydration health drain; timed effects expire. `StatusEffectRegistry` (status_effects.csv) keeps durations/modifiers in data. Cooking = the existing crafting recipes (cook_soup etc.) producing safer, more-satiating food. Inventory page shows satiation/hydration bars + active-effect chips.
   - **#3b — partly DONE (v0.334.0), rest tracked:** (a) **status-effect *modifier consumption*** — ✅ **SPEED done (v0.334.0):** the camera's `speed_multiplier` is set each frame from the player's active effects' `speed:X:multiply` mods (new `well_nourished` buff = +10% from a good meal; `thirsty`/`flu` = −20%), so movement buffs/debuffs are now tangible (`StatusEffectRegistry::net_stat_multiplier`). Still deferred: `stamina_regen` mods (need a stamina system) + `vision_range`/night_vision (need renderer wiring). (b) **night_vision from vitamins** — needs vitamin modeling in `NutritionProfile` + the vision wiring. (c) **a Drink action** — hydration currently only rises via watery food; add water/drink items + a Drink button. (d) **spoilage → nutrition** — spoiled food should lose nutrition / risk illness (FoodSystem tracks spoilage but doesn't yet apply it on eat). (e) **data-driven item→profile link** — `FoodSystem::profile_id_for` classifies by prefix (mirrors the existing spoilage classifier); a column on items.csv would make it fully data-driven.
4. **✅ DONE (v0.331.0) — Gardening loop** — PLANT (a seed item's "Plant" button → consume the seed → spawn a CropInstance), GROW (FarmingSystem already advances stage from game_time + water/health), WATER + HARVEST (mature crop → yield produce per plants.csv yield_min/max into the inventory → despawn) — all via the GUI→ECS bridge. The inventory page gains a **Garden panel** listing crops (stage / growth / water / health) with Water + Harvest buttons, plus a **"Dev: grow all"** testing affordance (skip the game-day wait). Mapping is `seed_<id>_0 → <id> → vegetable_/fruit_/grain_<id>_0`, validated against item_registry. Closes the chain: garden → harvest → cook/eat (#3).
   - **#4b deferred (tracked):** a data-driven `harvest_item` column on plants.csv (124 of 129 plants have no produce item in items.csv yet, so only the ~5 with matching items currently yield on harvest); soil/water-source entities + tilling/irrigation; 3D crop placement + visuals (crops are logical entities now, not yet placed/rendered in the world).
5. **✅ DONE (v0.332.0) — Drone↔asteroid mining** — new `AsteroidBody` (finite multi-ore entity) + `Drone` (Outbound→Mining→Returning→Done state machine) components + a registered `DroneSystem`. Commission a drone for an ore (Mining panel button → DroneSystem picks an asteroid that has it; home = the player) → it spends OUTBOUND+MINING+RETURNING seconds → delivers the mined ore into the player inventory; an asteroid mined to empty is **DELETED** (the operator's "consumed → deleted"). Mining mutations use intent-collection (no ECS borrow conflicts). Added `nickel_ore_0`/`platinum_ore_0` items + 2 test asteroids (iron/nickel/platinum/copper). The inventory page gains a **Mining panel**: asteroids + remaining ore, a commission button per available ore, and an active-drone list (ore/phase/cargo). Proven by `mining::drone_tests`.
   - **#5b deferred (tracked):** server-authoritative MMO asteroids (relay `GameWorld` — currently single-player native ECS) + the swarm + **abandoned**-deletion; 3D asteroid voxel visuals (`terrain::asteroid` octree exists, unused by the loop) + actual drone flight/position; refining nickel/platinum (smelt recipes) so the mined ore feeds the crafting tree.
6. **✅ DONE (v0.333.0) — Refining chain depth** — the ore mined in #5 is now refineable. Added `nickel_ingot_0` / `platinum_ingot_0` / `stainless_steel_ingot_0` items + `smelt_nickel` / `smelt_platinum` / `smelt_stainless` recipes (smelter_0). **2-tier depth:** ore → ingot (smelt_nickel) → alloy (smelt_stainless consumes iron_ingot **+** nickel_ingot). Closes **mine → refine → craft**. Locked by `crafting::refining_chain_tests` (recipes exist + every input/output is a real item + the multi-tier dependency holds). Pure data + a test — the crafting mechanism (#2) already executes any recipe.
   - **#6b deferred (tracked):** deeper trees (platinum → catalysts/electronics; more alloys), recipe **byproducts** (the schema supports them, data missing), chemistry→crafting links — the broad DB expansion the 2026-05-29 audit flagged, now meaningfully consumable because crafting/refining actually run.
7. **IN PROGRESS — Survival systems online.** **✅ #7a energy/rest (v0.335.0):** added `energy` to `Vitals` — drains while awake → `fatigued` (−15% speed, tangible via the #3b camera hook) below 25% → a **Rest** button (inventory vitals panel) refills it to full + grants `rested`. Survival baseline is now satiation + hydration + energy, all reusing the #3 vitals pattern. **#7b (next):** oxygen + temperature — these are **environment-coupled** (a real loop needs an enclosed-space/shelter/ambient-context layer, not just always-on meters with consumable refills); then sanitation/waste; then register the heavier sim systems (weather/atmosphere/hydrology/disasters) as their content entities spawn — each moves off the lint's deferred list.
8. **Progression layer (last)** — skills/XP/quests/tech-unlock gate the now-working systems.

Each step: register/wire the relevant system(s), spawn the content, verify with an
automated test where possible + the operator playing. The engine-wiring lint tracks which
systems have come online.
